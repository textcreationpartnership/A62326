            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Galatians,</hi> unto whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes this Epiſtle, had in his abſence been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſeduced from the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel which he had preached unto them, by ſome falſe Teachers that had crept in among them, and had perſwaded them, that tho' they did believe (and that rightly) that Jeſus was the true Meſſias whom the Prophets foretold ſhould come into the world, yet ſtill it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to be Circumciſed, and to conform to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (which they thought was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be abrogated) as well as to the Law of Chriſt, unto which they had ſo lately vowed Obedience. This Doctrine S. <hi>Paul</hi> confutes in this Epiſtle, and thunders an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt whoſoever he be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107594:6"/>that teaches it, though it were an Angel from Heaven. <hi>Though we,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> chap. 1.8. And afterwards in the cloſe of the Epiſtle, he proves to them at large, that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law was totally abrogated by the Law of Chriſt, and that by Faith in him, not only Jews, but Gentiles were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs of the Promiſe. <hi>Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; and the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathens through faith preached before the Goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed. So then they which be of faith are bleſſed with faithful Abraham,</hi> chap. 3. 7, 8, 9. And tho' indeed the Jews had moſt glorious Privileges and Favours conferred upon them by the bounty of God under the Moſaical Oeconomy, beyond what he had vouchſafed to any People upon earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (<hi>for unto them were committed the oracles of God,</hi> and they <hi>received the Law by the diſpoſition of Angels.</hi> God had choſen them to be his own peculiar People, his only viſible Church upon earth until the coming of the Meſſias: So that the Pſalmiſt had great reaſon to confeſs, that <hi>he had not dealt ſo with any Nation</hi>) yet for all this our Apoſtle aſſures them, that how great ſoever theſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Jews might ſeem (and indeed really were) in compariſon of what God had vouchſafed to other Nations, during the time of the Law, yet they were, far inferiour to thoſe which the Church was afterwards to enjoy under the Oeconomy of the Goſpel, the glorious and everlaſting Kingdom of Chriſt: Whereupon he reſembles the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107594:6"/>School-maſter</hi> which was to <hi>bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith,</hi> chap. 3.24. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>After that faith is come, we are no longer under a School-maſter. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this fourth Chapter he compares the Church under the Law to an Heir in his Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Church under the Goſpel to an Heir now come to Age, and in Poſſeſſion of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. <hi>Now, I ſay, that the Heir, as long as he is a Child, differeth nothing from a Servant, though he be Lord of all; but is under Tutors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, until the time appointed of the father. Even ſo we, when we were children, were in bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Elements of the world. But when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſee the coherence and ſcope of the Text; and ye cannot chuſe but apprehend, at the firſt view of it, that it is very ſutable to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Seaſon, and that it will furniſh us with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Matter, with a moſt magnificent and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Feaſt of fit and proper Meditations, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain our Souls with at this great Feſtival, which we celebrate in Memory of the wonderful Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Nativity of our bleſſed Saviour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is hard to inſtance in any other Text of Scripture, wherein the whole Myſtery of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Incarnation is ſo amply and fully explained in ſo few words, as it is in theſe which I have now made choice of for the Subject of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which evidently contains all theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truths. 1. Here is our Saviour's Divinity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in theſe words, <hi>God ſent forth his Son.</hi> 2. Here is his Humanity, together with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he became Man, and how qualified;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107594:7"/>
                  <hi>made of a woman, made under the law.</hi> 3. The time when the bleſſed Son of God was thus ſent forth; it was <hi>when the fulneſs of the time was come.</hi> 4. The reaſon, or end, of his Miſſion; it was <hi>to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> But though I ſhall, more or leſs, touch upon all theſe Points, yet for the more plainneſs I ſhall confine my ſelf to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: I ſhall prove to you, that our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſias, whom God hath long ſince ſent forth into the world, and that no other is to be expected: and this I ſhall do, as by other Arguments, ſo particularly by theſe which are mentioned in my Text, the time when, the manner how, and the reaſon and end wherefore he came into the world. The coming of the Meſſias is a matter of ſo great importance, that it concerns all Mankind diligently to enquire about it, and to inform themſelves aright whether he be already come, or no; and if he be, who is the true Meſſias, whom God hath ſent into the world. For to erre in this Point, is the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Error imaginable, an Error that inevitably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles us to Damnation; for it is moſt certain, that <hi>in the Meſſias were all the Families of the Earth to be bleſſed:</hi> and as all Mankind ſhare in the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our firſt Parents, by which we loſt our ſtate of Innocence, and fell into a ſtate of Sin and Death, and became obnoxious to the wrath of God; ſo hath all Mankind an intereſt likewiſe in the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, who hath <hi>deſtroyed the works of the Devil, aboliſhed Death, and brought life and immortality to light;</hi> and by vertue of this Intereſt every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> hath a right to God's favour, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Title to the Kingdom of Heaven; if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107594:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>he loſes not this Intereſt, and this Title to that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inheritance, by unbelief. And ſince God was graciouſly pleaſed to ſhew ſo great Mercy to Mankind (greater than whatever he vouchſafed to any of his Creatures beſides) as to reconcile them unto himſelf, through the Mediation of the Meſſias; it was neceſſary for him to give the world timely notice, that in his good time he would ſend ſuch a perſon into it, who ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this great work; and alſo to deſcribe him ſo plainly, by ſuch infallible Marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as that the whole World might be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his coming, that he might be viſibly diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible from all Mankind beſides; that no man might be miſtaken in him, ſo as to adhere to a falſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, or to reject the true one, except it were ſuch as took little, or no care to inform themſelves, or ſuch as were wilfully obſtinate, and reſolved to ſhut their Eyes againſt the cleareſt light. And that God hath done thus, is granted even by the very enemies of Chriſtianity. The Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledge it: and indeed every man muſt needs do ſo that knows the Scriptures, and owns them to be the word of God. He declared this gracious Deſign of his to ſend the Meſſias even in the very beginning of the world; and no ſooner had our firſt Parents brought themſelves into a condition to need a Saviour, but God preſently aſſures them that he hath ordained one for them, and that <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head.</hi> He declared it afterwards more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs; more fully yet to <hi>Moſes:</hi> And laſtly, moſt clearly of all by the Prophets; for <hi>to him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witneſs.</hi> If then theſe things be ſo (as moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107594:8"/>certainly they are) it is plain that by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures we may moſt evidently diſcern whether the Meſſias be already come or no; and if he be come, who he is, that we may believe in him. And that he is already come, and that our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is he, will be undeniably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from theſe following Arguments; in the managing of which I ſhall ſhew you, how exactly the New Teſtament and the Old agree together, like two Indentures to prove this great Truth which both of them chiefly aim at, that Jeſus is the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, or Chriſt, which is the ſame thing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language ſignifying, <hi>Anointed,</hi> a Perſon ſet apart and appointed by God, to a moſt high and eminent Office and Employment.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, that Jeſus is the true Meſſias appears from his coming into the world punctually at the time, wherein God had foretold in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, that the Meſſias ſhould come. So ſaith our Apoſtle here in my Text, <hi>When the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his ſon,</hi> i. e. at that juncture of time which God had appointed and foretold by his Prophets. That the coming of the Meſſias ſhould be deferred for ſome conſiderable time was very reaſonable; that men might the more earneſtly deſire, and long for the Accompliſhment of ſo great a Bleſſing: and it was as reaſonable that the exact time of his coming ſhould be pointed at, and decyphered by ſome remarkable Signs and Tokens; that they might not be weary of exſpecting him before the time was come; or when it was come, that they might not be unable to know him, and continue to expect another. And accordingly God hath dealt with the world: He ſent not the Meſſias
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107594:8"/>quickly (for he came not until the World was near 4000 years old) and, beſides other later Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of it, he punctually foretold the time when he ſhould come near 1700 years before-hand: all which Prophecies agree exactly even by the Jews own Confeſſion) to the time of our Saviour's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fleſh. I ſhall inſtance only in theſe three as being the chief and principal of them, and abundantly ſufficient of themſelves without the concurrence of any other to prove this Point. The firſt is that ancient Prophecy of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.10. <hi>The Sceptre ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be.</hi> All the ancient Expoſitors of the Jews underſtand theſe words as we do) to be a Prophecy of the coming of the Meſſias, called here by the name of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>ſent,</hi> or, as ſome perhaps better interpret it, a Peace-maker, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Sceptre ſhould not depart from Judah,</hi> i. e. that that Tribe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue all along, without any Interruption, to be a Body politick, having a power of Government and Juriſdiction within it ſelf, until the coming of the Meſſias, the great Peace-maker, whom God would ſend to reconcile the world unto himſelf. Thus far the Jews and we are agreed about the ſenſe of this Text: But we ſay further, that it means not only that the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be inveſted with the power of Government within it ſelf, until the coming of the Meſſias (as it is manifeſt that it did, after it had once received that Power, from <hi>David</hi>'s time until the coming of our Saviour) but that it ſhould be deprived of this Power, and ceaſe to be a Commonwealth ſoon after the coming of the Meſſias: and that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107594:9"/>it did ſo about 40 years after our Saviour's Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion is matter of Fact, as evident and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable as the other. Nay more than thus, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is plain in Chronology, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of the Jews was not deſtroyed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Birth of our Saviour, nor immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his Death. This Prophecy points directly at the time when that fatal Deſtruction ſhould come upon them, that ſhould wreſt the Sceptre out of their hands, if we underſtand it as the Learned Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> doth, much more agreeably to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and to the completion of it, than is our Engliſh Tranſlation, <hi>viz.</hi> thus, <hi>The Sceptre ſhall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come, and the gathering of the people be to him:</hi> and ſo it is plain that this Deſtruction of the Jewiſh Polity was not to happen immediately upon the coming of the Meſſias; but firſt the people were to be gathered unto him, i. e. were to ſubmit to his Government, and to own him for their Lord; which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, when the Apoſtles had executed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which our Saviour gave them, and had converted the Gentiles in all Countreys of the then known World to the Chriſtian Faith: then immediately followed the utter Subverſion of the Jewiſh State, as our Saviour had foretold. Matth. 24.14 <hi>This Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be preached in all the world, for a witneſs unto all Nations; and then ſhall the end come.</hi> Then did the Sceptre fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and totally depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> according to this ancient Prophecy of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Prophecy which I ſhall inſtance in, to prove that our Saviour came at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for the coming of the Meſſias is Hagg. 2.6, 7, and 9th Verſes. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107594:9"/>of hoſts; yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land; and I will ſhake all nations, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all nations ſhall come: and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than of the former, ſaith the Lord of hoſts: and in this place will I give peace, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Unto which I ſhall joyn that of <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. as being exactly parallel. <hi>Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger, and be ſhall prepare the way before me: and the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple, even the Meſſenger of the covenant whom ye delight in: behold he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> The chief end and deſign of both theſe Prophecies is to foretel that the Meſſias ſhould come while the ſecond Temple was ſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> that Temple which was built by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> after that the Jews were returned from the Babyloniſh Captivity, and afterwards repaired and beautified by <hi>Herod.</hi> Thus the ancient Rabbies and Doctors of the Jews underſtood theſe Texts, as well as we, however their modern Writers now labour to wreſt them to ſome other ſenſe, that they may not be forced to own our Saviour to be the true Meſſias, at whom it is evident nevertheleſs, that theſe Texts do directly point. For whereas (as we read <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3.12.) when <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> had begun to build this Temple, many of the ancient men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, that remembred the former Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that was built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> wept, when they conſidered how much inferiour this would be to that; thereupon God ſends the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> to encourage them in the building of it, and to aſſure them, <hi>That the glory of this latter houſe ſhould be greater than of the former.</hi> But wherein was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107594:10"/>the Glory of this Temple greater than that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's?</hi> Indeed it laſted a little the longer of the two, and but a little; not the Age of a man; for it never attain'd to be threeſcore and ten years older than the former. But if it had laſted twice as long, what is this to the Glory and Splendour of it? For if Glory be the product of Age, then an old Cottage is more honourable than a new Palace. And as for any other Glory, except that which it received by being honoured by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Meſſias, it is certain, that in all other reſpects it came far ſhort of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple. For who can with any reaſon ſuppoſe that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Nation newly returned out of Captivity, from under the hand of a potent Enemy, ſhould have ſo much Wealth and Riches as to be able to build a Temple that might vie with that of <hi>Solomon's,</hi> who <hi>exceeded all the Kings of the earth for riches and for wiſdom?</hi> And though it be true, that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> gave very large and magnificent Contributions towards the building of this ſecond Temple, yet is it not to be imagined that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> an Heathen King, either took ſo much care, or beſtowed ſo much coſt about the building of this Temple, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did about his, who according to that mighty Wiſdom and Riches, with which God had bleſſed him, built unto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God's name, both for Coſt and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, undoubtedly the ſtatelieſt Fabrick that ever the world beheld. Neither is it at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that <hi>Herod,</hi> when he rebuilt and beautified this Temple anew made it equal to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s. But ſuppoſe it had been equal to it, or exceeded it in the Splendour and Magnificence of its building; yet it is certain (and the Jews themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107594:10"/>it) that it was far inferiour to it, in matters of an higher Nature. For gold and ſilver, and precious ſtones were the leaſt part of the Glory of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple. Its greateſt Glory was that God was pleaſed to make it the peculiar place as it were of his Reſidence, and eſpecial Preſence here upon Earth, <hi>The place where his honour dwelt,</hi> and that far more viſibly and eminently, than ever it did in the ſecond Temple before the coming of Chriſt. For beſides that, at the Dedication of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple we read that <hi>Fire came down</hi> in a wonderful manner <hi>from Heaven, and conſumed the burnt offering and the ſacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the houſe,</hi> ſo that by reaſon of it <hi>the Prieſts</hi> were <hi>not</hi> able to <hi>enter</hi> into it; and there is no mention made of any ſuch Miracles being ſhewed at the Dedication of the ſecond; it had alſo the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> and the Ark of the Covenant, which were ſignal Tokens of the Divine Preſence, and from whence God was wont to give Anſwers to the High Prieſt when he came to enquire of him, both which were wanting in the ſecond. To this we may add alſo the Spirit of Prophecy, ſo frequently manifeſt in the Prophets during the time of the firſt Temple, and ceaſing all the time of the ſecond, for about 400 years together, even from <hi>Malachy,</hi> the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Old Teſtament, until the coming of our Saviour. Since then in all theſe reſpects the Glory of the ſecond Temple was far ſhort of that of the former, and yet God here by his Prophet promiſes to make it greater; it muſt needs be that it was greater only by being honoured with the gracious Preſence of the Meſſias, unto whom alone thoſe glorious Titles mentioned in the afore-cited
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107594:11"/>Prophecies do properly belong, <hi>The deſire of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the Lord whom ye ſeek;</hi> and <hi>the Meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in.</hi> And who ſhould this Meſſias be but our bleſſed Saviour, who came while this Temple was yet ſtanding, and foretold that it ſhould be deſtroyed in the ſame Age, and moreover declared himſelf to be the Meſſias, and confirmed and demonſtrated it by ſuch wonders and miracles as the World never ſaw either before, or ſince. It was he therefore that rendered the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple truly more glorious than the firſt, when he taught in it ſuch heavenly Doctrine, ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any thing that had before been revealed unto the World, and filled it with <hi>his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Prophecy which I ſhall produce for the Confirmation of this point is, <hi>Dan</hi> 9.24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy People, and upon thy holy City,</hi> &amp;c. and ver. 26. it is ſaid, that <hi>after threeſcore and two weeks ſhall Meſſiah be cut off.</hi> Now that this Prophecy is an exact Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the time when our bleſſed Saviour was to ſuffer, and alſo of the time of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the unanimous Opinion of all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judicious Expoſitors, who by the ſeventy week here mentioned underſtand weeks for years (<hi>i e.</hi>) ſeventy times ſeven years, which amounts to juſt 490. At the end of thoſe years (reckoning from the timewhen the ſecond Temple was finiſhed) was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be deſtroyed, and a final period to be put to the Jewiſh State; which learned Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers have computed to fall out accordingly (as near as can be gueſſed in a matter ſo remote from our times) almoſt to a day; and the threeſcore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107594:11"/>and two weeks alſo when the Meſſiah was to be cut off, to expire exactly at the time when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was crucified. That theſe things were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> both the Crucifixion of our Saviour, and the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time foretold in this Prophecy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo plain in Hiſtory, that it cannot be denied with any tolerable ſhew of reaſon: and therefore the Jews, ſince they are forced to acknowledge, that both our Saviour's Crucifixion, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> fell out exactly about the time foretold in this Prophecy, being thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that they may not own our Saviour to be the Meſſias, deny that by that word the Meſſias himſelf is here intended, but that it means ſome other perſon; but who that is they are by no means agreed; ſome applying it to one perſon, and ſome to another, to at leaſt five ſeveral perſons amongſt them, and to never a one of theſe with the leaſt probability of truth, which that it is a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable obſtinacy appears from this one remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obſervation, that the Meſſias is no where call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own name directly, as he is here <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ver. 26. and more Emphatically, to prevent all miſtakes, in the preceding Verſe, <hi>Meſſiah the Prince</hi> in any other place, but this throughout all the Old Teſtament; but only by way of Type e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where elſe: and it is very likely that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jews before our Saviour's time, learn'd to give unto the Meſſias his proper name from this very Prophecy, which they will not own now, to have any relation to him; ſo ſtrange a Power hath prejudice to pervert and blind the Hearts of men. Thus I have made it ſufficiently evident by theſe three ſamous Prophecies, that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107594:12"/>
                  <hi>Haggai,</hi> (joyntly conſidered together with that of <hi>Malachy</hi>) and this of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that our Saviour is the true Meſſias, foraſmuch as he came into the world <hi>when the fulneſs of the time was come,</hi> foretold and ſignified by all theſe Prophecies, and declared himſelf to be the Meſſias, which none elſe did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time, but only ſome few notorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, which were all quickly renounced as ſuch, even by their own moſt zealous Diſciples and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. I might prove this Truth further from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral more Arguments, which I could produce out of the Old Teſtament for this purpoſe, as alſo from the general Opinion and Expectation which the Jews had, that the Meſſias ſhould come about that very time when our Saviour was born, which no doubt was grounded upon theſe Prophecies which I have been handling, and others of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And that they did at that time expect the Meſſias is evident, not only from their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but even from ſome of the Heathen Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: for both <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> tell us, that at that time the Jews were in great Expectation of a mighty Perſon that ſhould riſe up amongſt them, under whoſe Conduct and Government their Nation ſhould flouriſh far beyond whatever it had done in former times, even ſo as to become the Head of all the World: which Opinion was their ruin in a ſhort time afterwards, for it made them ſo confident, that upon this Preſumption they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo obſtinately, that at the laſt they were utterly deſtroyed by them, and their City and Temple demoliſhed. But I have already ſaid enough to clear this Truth, that our bleſſed Saviour came into the world preciſely at that time, which God by his Prophets had foretold and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107594:12"/>prefixed for the coming of the Meſſias, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that he is the true Meſſias, ſince none other, neither about that time, nor ſince, ever laid claim to that Title with any probable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of truth; neither can any one do it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſeeing that, if theſe Prophecies be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fulfilled, it is now many Ages too late for the accompliſhment of them: for <hi>the fulneſs of the time</hi> is long ſince paſt, and <hi>God</hi> hath already <hi>ſent forth his ſon made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi>

               <p>IN the handling of this portion of Scripture, I undertook to prove this Propoſition, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſias, whom God hath long ſince ſent into the world, and none other is to be expected. This I have cleared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in one particular, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the time when, according to the Predictions of the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, the Meſſias was to come; which I have proved to be the very ſame time in which our bleſſed Saviour was born. <hi>When the fulneſs of the time was come God ſent forth his ſon.</hi> Thus far therefore it is evident, that our Saviour hath a juſt right to the Title of the Meſſias, in that he appeared in the world preciſely, at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed by God for the coming of the Meſſias. But this Circumſtance alone (although without it all others would be too little) is not ſufficient of it ſelf to put this matter out of Diſpute: and had we no other Argument but this for the proof of our Propoſition, we ſhould be altogether as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in believing in Jeſus Chriſt, as the Jews are in rejecting him, when they find this one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Circumſtance attended and corroborated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107594:13"/>beyond all Exception, with every other material and neceſſary Circumſtance mentioned in the Old Teſtament, relating both to the perſon and office of the Meſſias. For it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that our Saviour was the only perſon that was born at that time. No, without queſtion there were thouſands in the world that were born at the ſame inſtant; many of the ſame Tribe; perhaps ſome very near the time of the ſame Family, and in the ſame City: for we find in the Goſpel, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of his brethren and kindred. This Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the time therefore, though it be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to prove our Propoſition; yet it is not ſufficient of it ſelf, being applicable to other perſons as well as to the Meſſias; but will moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate it being joyned with the two other Circumſtances contain'd in my Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how our Saviour came into the World; and the reaſon, or end wherefore he came; which I come now to conſider: In the doing of which I ſhall ſhew you firſt, that our bleſſed Saviour came into the World exactly in the ſame manner, in which the Prophets in the Old Teſtament foretold that the Meſſias ſhould come; ſecondly, that he came for thoſe very reaſons and ends, for which the Prophets foretold that the Meſſias ſhould come, and that he effected and accompliſhed thoſe ends in the very ſame way and method that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Predictions of the ſame Prophets, the Meſſias was to do.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, our bleſſed Saviour came into the World in the very ſame manner, punctually, even in every minute Circumſtance, in which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foretold that the Meſſias ſhould come. Our Apoſtle here in my Text takes notice only of theſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107594:14"/>two; that <hi>he was made of a woman,</hi> and that <hi>he was made under the law:</hi> but I ſhall handle this Point more largely, not conſining my ſelf to theſe two Particulars only, but inſiſting upon all the moſt material Circumſtances that were to attend the coming of the Meſſias; and in ſo doing I ſhall ſhew that they were all fulfilled to a tittle in the manner of our Saviour's appearing in the world. Now the chief Circumſtances relating to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Meſſias appearing in the world are theſe. 1. of what Tribe he was to be; 2. of what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of that Tribe. 3. in what Town he was to be born. 4. in what Manner. 5. in what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Condition. The firſt Circumſtance to be enquired into is, of what Tribe the Meſſias was to be: and in this particular the Jews agree with us, that he was to be of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>The ſceptre ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come;</hi> upon which account that Tribe was by God honoured with many ſignal and eminent Privileges, beyond any other of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now that our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was of this Tribe is a thing ſo undeniable, that the Apoſtle writing to the Jews takes it for granted that they all acknowedged it, without any diſpute. Hebr. 7.14. <hi>For it is evident that our Lord ſprang out of Judah:</hi> which Expreſſion he would never have uſed had it not been a thing ſo certain, and known to be ſo at the time when he wrote his Epiſtle, that no man could deny it. But this will appear yet more clearly from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſecond Circumſtance, obſervable in the coming of the Meſſias, <hi>viz.</hi> of what Family he was to be: and that was of the Family of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107594:14"/>
                  <hi>David,</hi> who it is moſt certain was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> And this was ſo plainly and frequently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, that the Jews themſelves never made any queſtion of it, but do even unto this day expect that their imaginary Meſſias, whom they yet look for, ſhall ariſe out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>David.</hi> This Promiſe God made unto <hi>David,</hi> and confirmed it with his Oath. Pſal. 89. 35. <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lie unto David. His ſeed ſhall endure for ever, and his throne as the ſun before me. It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the moon, and as the faithful witneſs in heaven.</hi> So Iſa. 11.1. <hi>There ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, and a branch ſhall grow out of his roots: and the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> &amp;c. And ver 10. <hi>There ſhall be a root of Jeſſe, which ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the people; to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek: and his reſt ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> By theſe Texts, together with ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the ſame purpoſe, the Jews were fully convinced of this Truth, that the Meſſias was to be of the Family of <hi>David;</hi> inſomuch that they uſed that Expreſſion of <hi>the ſon of David</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Meſſias, unto whom in a peculiar and eminent manner it properly belonged, as appears by the Acclamations of the multitudes that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended our Saviour, when he rode in triumph to <hi>Jeruſalem, Crying, Hoſanna to the ſon of David,</hi> Matth. 21.9 And in the next Chapter, ver. 42. when our Saviour asks the <hi>Phariſees</hi> this queſtion, <hi>What think ye of Chriſt? whoſe ſon is he?</hi> They readily anſwer him, without any ſcruple, <hi>The ſon of David;</hi> though they could not ſo readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him the next queſtion, <hi>How then doth David in ſpirit call him Lord, ſaying, The Lord ſaid unto
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107594:15"/>my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footſtool.</hi> Thus then it is plain, that the Meſſias was to be the Son of <hi>David:</hi> and it is as plain, that our bleſſed Saviour whom we believe to be the Meſſias was the Son of <hi>David:</hi> for S. <hi>Matthew</hi> gives an account of his Genealogy from <hi>Abraham;</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> proceeds farther, and reckons it even from <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf: and that both theſe Evangeliſts were faithful in the account that they have given us of it is manifeſt, in that the Jews never offered to find any flaw or errour in it; which certainly they would have done, if there had been any ſuch failure to have been found, and have made the whole World acquainted with it. But by the providence of God, until the coming of the Meſſias, the Genealogies of the Jews were ſo carefully recorded and preſerved, for this very reaſon, that it might be apparent, when the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias did come, that he was of the Family of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> according to the Predictions of the Prophets, that there could be no diſpute about this Point. This is the ſecond Circumſtance obſervable in the manner of the Meſſias his coming into the World, he was to be the Son of <hi>David;</hi> and ſo was our Saviour. The next is the place where he was to be born. And herein the Jews agree with us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that, according to the Predictions of the Prophets, the Meſſias was to be born in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> For ſo we read, Mic. 5.2 <hi>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah; yet out of thee ſhall be come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael; whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from everlaſting.</hi> Now that the Jews did expect the Meſſias ſhould be born in that City is plain, from the anſwer which the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107594:15"/>Scribes and chief Prieſts gave to <hi>Herod,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled at the News which the wiſe men of the Eaſt brought him, of a King being born unto the Jews, he enquired of them where Chriſt ſhould be born; they anſwered with one accord, <hi>In Bethlehem of Judea,</hi> grounding their anſwer upon this Prediction of the Prophet <hi>Micah.</hi> And ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.42. when the people were divided in their Opinions concerning our Saviour, and <hi>many ſaid, Of a truth this is the Prophet. Others ſaid, This is the Chriſt. But ſome ſaid</hi> (perhaps not knowing where our Saviour was born, or elſe maliciouſly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to know it) <hi>ſhall Chriſt come out of Galilee? Hath not the Scripture ſaid, that Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of David, and out of the Town of Bethlehem, where David was?</hi> By theſe paſſages it appears, that the Jews did unanimouſly confeſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Meſſias, or Chriſt, was to be born in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> And that our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was born there, both S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> have fully aſſured us. The manner and occaſion of his being born there is moſt punctually record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the latter: and it will be worth our while to take a ſhort view of it, being a thing wonderfully effected by the ſecret and over-ruling Providence of God, contrary to all likelihood and probability, that the prediction of the Prophet concerning this matter might be fulfilled. For had not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our been born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the Jews had then had an invincible Argument againſt us, to prove him not to be the Meſſias. And that he ſhould be born there was very unlikely, until within a few days before it came to paſs. For both <hi>Joſeph</hi> and the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> dwelt together at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> about twenty Miles from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> from the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107594:16"/>time, when at the Salutation of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> ſhe conceived our Saviour, until the time of her Delivery was at hand, excepting only thoſe three Months which ſhe ſpent with her Couſin <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> in the Hilly Countrey, from whence we read expreſly, that ſhe <hi>returned to her own houſe,</hi> Luk. 1.56. In all probability therefore, our Saviour was likely to be born at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> had not God unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ordered the matter otherwiſe: which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did. For when her full time drew near, by a Decree of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> both <hi>Joſeph</hi> and ſhe (no doubt much againſt their Wills, as not being then very able to undertake a Journey) are conſtrained to go to be taxed in the Town belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Family, which was <hi>Bethlehem. And ſo it was,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Luke, that while they were there, the days were accompliſhed that ſhe ſhould be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſhe brought forth her firſt-born ſon, and wrapped him in ſwadling clothes, and laid him in a manger; becauſe there was no room for them in the Inn,</hi> Luk. 2.6, 7. Thus did God in his great Wiſdom order this matter ſo, that (all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>David</hi> being called together at the ſame time, as it were on purpoſe to be Witneſſes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Birth) we might not want ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to prove, that our bleſſed Lord was not only born of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but alſo in the Town of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> The next Circumſtance to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the coming of the Meſſias is the manner of his Birth, and this was to be wonderful: for he was to be born of a pure Virgin, a thing which never did, nor ever ſhall, happen to any man in the World beſides. This was foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 7.14. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Immanuel;</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:107594:16"/>which, as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, being interpreted, is, <hi>God with us,</hi> and that in a peculiar and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous manner, ſo as he never was with any other Creature but man; with us by a perſonal, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union. Now that this is an expreſs Prophecy of the Birth of the Meſſias, is ſo clear that it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no tolerable grounds for any Objections to be made againſt it. For unto whom can that great name <hi>Immanuel</hi> properly belong, but unto that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bleſſed Perſon, that was to mediate betwixt God and Man, and reconcile them together? Or upon whom can we imagine that God would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the honour of ſuch a Birth, if not upon the Meſſias, who was undoubtedly to be honoured with far more glorious Privileges than any other of the Sons of men beſides? Since then God by his Prophet did foretel that ſuch a wonder as this ſhould be effected, that <hi>a Virgin ſhould conceive and bear a ſon,</hi> we cannot with any probability imagine that any other perſon ſhould be ſo born but only the Meſſias. And that he is here meant, is yet more fully evident from the Character which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet gives of him afterwards, Chap. 9.6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, and his name ſhall be called, Wonderful Councellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> Theſe high Titles can be applied to no other perſon but to the Meſſias; which is yet more clear by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next Verſe. <hi>Of the increaſe of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and peace there ſhall be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with judgment and with juſtice, from henceforth even for ever.</hi> Certainly none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon but the Meſſias was to ſit for ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107594:17"/>the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> even by the Confeſſion of the Jews themſelves. It is true, that there is not any one thing in all the Goſpel which the Jews are more unwilling to believe than this, that our Saviour came into the world by ſuch a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Birth as this, this one Circumſtance being in a manner of it ſelf ſufficient to convince any reaſonable perſon that whoſoever was ſo born could be none elſe but the Meſſias: And therefore, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they will give credit to it, they deny that either in this place, or any other in the Old Teſtament, God ever foretold that the Meſſias ſhould be born of a pure Virgin; whereby they rob him of one of the higheſt and moſt honourable Privileges that God beſtowed upon him upon Earth. And for proof of this, againſt all ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they affirm that the Hebrew word in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which we tranſlate <hi>Virgin,</hi> doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifie ſo; but is ſometimes uſed for a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Woman; and that it ought to be ſo render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this place. Which is a moſt malicious and falſe Aſſertion, and contains two notorious errors and abſurdities, the one viſible only to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other eaſily diſcernible by men of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Capacities. For ſirſt, learned Men, that are as well acquainted with the Hebrew Tongue as the Jews themſelves, have evidently made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that whereſoever this word occurs in any other place of the Old Teſtament it always ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a pure and undefiled Virgin; and no tolerable reaſon can be given, why it may not ſignifie ſo in this place as well as in all the reſt; nay on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary very great reaſon may be given, why in this place above all others it may, and muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſignifie a Virgin as well as elſewhere, foraſmuch
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107594:17"/>as otherwiſe this Prophecy will be made down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Nonſenſe; which is the ſecond abſurdity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Aſſertion of the Jews, which I ſay is obvious enough to be diſcerned by an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Capacity. For this Prophecy was delivered upon this occaſion; <hi>Ahaz</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> being much afraid of the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> that were coming to war againſt him, God ſends the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to comfort him, and to aſſure him that they ſhall not prevail againſt him, and withal gives him leave to ask ſome great Sign to be given him, to ſatisfie him that God would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly protect him, which when he refuſed to do (<hi>I will not ask,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither will I tempt the Lord</hi>) God himſelf moſt graciouſly promiſes to give him a Sign; <hi>therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign.</hi> And ſurely if God pleaſes to give a Sign he will give ſuch a one as is worthy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, one that is exceedingly wonderful and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. But after all, as the Jews would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Text, the Sign only to be this. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a woman ſhall conceive and bear a ſon.</hi> What Sign, what Wonder is there in this? Certainly no more than what is to be ſeen every day, every hour, every minute in one place or other in the world. If therefore we interpret the Text thus, it is not reconcileable to Senſe. But as our Tranſlation renders it (<hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon</hi>) this is a Wonder indeed, ſuch as the world never did, nor ever ſhall, behold, but once; this is an aſtoniſhing Sign, worthy of God to give, and a Prerogative ſo eminent as none elſe but the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias was worthy to receive. Now that our bieſſed Saviour was born of a pure Virgin, is a thing ſo clearly revealed and firmly atteſted by perſons of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107594:18"/>unqueſtionable Fidelity and Integrity authorized and commiſſioned by God himſelf to give the world a true account of theſe matters, and guided and aſſiſted by his Spirit in the doing of it, that it can be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nothing leſs obſtinate than the ſame malice which would pervert the ſenſe of that famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy which foretold it. That the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles have given us this account of the Birth of our Saviour is ſo well known, that I need not inſiſt upon it; and to prove that their Writings are the word of God, and conſequently that they are moſt certainly and infallibly true, is beyond my preſent Purpoſe, which is to ſhew that there is not any one Prophecy in the Old Teſtament concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſias which we find not punctually ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, even to the leaſt tittle, in the perſon of our Saviour in that account, which the Evangeliſts have given us of him, which ſufficiently demonſtrates him to be the true Meſſias, and their Writings to be of Divine Authority. This manner of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Birth is very emphatically expreſſed by our Apoſtle in my Text. <hi>God ſent forth his ſon made of a woman.</hi> As he is God he is not made, but begotten of the Father by an eternal and unſpeakable Generation; and as he is Man he was not begotten, but made of a woman after an unconceivable manner, by the omnipotent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God. And thus it was neceſſary, that the Meſſias ſhould make his Entry into the world, who was to be conceived and born without ſin, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Womb, <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners.</hi> Thus much of the fourth Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance relating to the manner of the Meſſias his appearing in the world. He was to be born of a Virgin; and ſo was our Saviour.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107594:18"/>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is in what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Condition he was to come. This is that grand Stumbling-block at which the Jews are irreconcilably ſcandalized. They are very ready to acknowledge that our Saviour appeared in the world in a very poor and deſpicable State, and thus far they believe the Goſpel as well as we: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did appear in ſuch a Condition they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny him to be the Meſſias, whom they ſtill expect to come with exceeding great Pomp and Splendour, and Glory becoming ſo great a King as was to ſit for ever upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and to ſuddue all the Nations of the Earth, and to reduce them to his obedience. Had our Saviour come in this manner, and made their Nation the head of the World, it is more than probable that this one Circumſtance would have fully ſatisfied them, and without any ſcrupulous Enquiry of what Tribe he was born, of what Family, in what Place, and in what manner they would have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly proclaimed him to be the true Meſſias, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the redeemer of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But that a perſon of ſo mean and obſcure a Birth as our Saviour was, one, who as to his external Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, made ſo inconſiderable a figure in the world, that the Carpenter the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> (as they ſcornfully called him) ſhould declare himſelf to be the greateſt of all the Sons of men, their ſo long expected, and earneſtly deſired Meſſias, the Son of God, and the King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they lookt upon to be ſo great an affront to their Nation; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of owning him to be the Meſſias, they reject him as an Impoſtor, and cut him off by an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death, little knowing that in all this they fulfilled the Scriptures, and that their very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107594:19"/>rejection, and Crucifixion of him were all neceſſary and material Arguments, which we could by no means have wanted, to prove him to be the true Meſſias. Since then we cannot deny that our bleſſed Saviour did come into the world in a poor and mean Condition, far different from that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Jews expected the Meſſias ſhould appear; in ſuch a Condition indeed in which humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, would little imagine that God would ſend into the world his only begotten Son, the Son of his eternal Love, in whom he is well pleaſed, him who was to be ſo highly <hi>exalted, and to have a name given him above every name.</hi> For all the world as well as the Jews might very reaſonably expect that ſuch a perſon as this would come attended with the moſt pompous and magnificent Circumſtances imaginable, ſuitable to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Glory of him who was to be <hi>higher than the Kings of the earth;</hi> it concerns us above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances relating to the coming of the Meſſias, firmly and ſubſtantially to prove this, which of all others ſeems to be the moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he was to come in this mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Condition. For ſince it is manifeſt from the Writings of the Prophets that the Meſſias was to be a moſt mighty King, <hi>of the increaſe of whoſe Government and Peace there ſhould be no end upon the throne of David and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with judgment and with juſtice for ever;</hi> if this great perſon was to be born of mean Parents, in a Stable, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his life time to continue in a Condition anſwerable to that obſcure Birth; not to enjoy ſo much as an houſe of his own wherein to hide his head; to be deſpiſed and hated by his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107594:19"/>and perſecuted unto Death; it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that God by his Prophets ſhould foretel this alſo; or elſe it could never have been expected that when he did come, any Man living ſhould have been able to diſcern him in ſo ſtrange a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, God having no where revealed any ſuch thing. But if God hath revealed this alſo, as clearly as any of the aforementioned Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and hath by his Prophets as plainly foretold the Humiliation of the Meſſias, as his Exaltation; then it is evident that our Saviour's coming in that mean Condition, in which we confeſs he did, is ſo far from being any Objection againſt us, that, joyned with the former Circumſtances, and with what I ſhall further inſiſt upon, it is an unanſwerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove that he is the true Meſſias; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he came exactly in ſuch a Quality and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as God by his Prophets foretold the Meſſias ſhould come in. And that God did foretel that the Meſſias ſhould appear in this low and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State, beſides other places of Scripture, we have the whole 53d. Chap. of the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to convince us; which of all others is the moſt full and plain Prophecy, both of the Humiliation and Exaltation of Chriſt. And it is a wonderful thing that the Jews even to this day ſhould continue ſo obſtinate as not to believe it; though this very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and unbelief of theirs is a very ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our Faith, ſince even this alſo is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly foretold by the Prophet, and that in the very firſt words of the Chapter: He uſhers in his Prophecy with an admiration at the ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unbelief of his People, who he foreſaw would not receive it. <hi>Who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:107594:20"/>And then in the two following Verſes he gives an exact Deſcription of this mean Condition in which the Meſſias was to come. <hi>He ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; he hath no form nor comelineſs: and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him. He is deſpiſed and rejected of men; a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him: he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not.</hi> Now if this be truly (as we affirm it is) a Prophecy of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, it is manifeſt, that it agrees exactly with the manner of our Saviour's appearing in the world. And though the modern Jews deny it to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of him, yet we have ſufficient Arguments to prove that it is. I ſhall inſtance only in theſe two. Firſt it is very unreaſonable to imagine, that God would ſuffer every punctilio of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to be completely accompliſhed and fulfilled, in the perſon of one who owned and declared himſelf to be the Meſſias, except the Prophecy were really intended of the Meſſias, and he in whom it was ſo fulfilled, were that very perſon whom it meant. Now that there is not one tittle of this Prophecy which was not fulfilled in the perſon of our Saviour, who profeſſed himſelf to be the Meſſias, and applied this Prophecy to himſelf, is evident in the account the Evangeliſts have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us of him: and then it follows, not only that this is a Prophecy of the Meſſias, but alſo that our Saviour is the Meſſias whom it points at. The ſecond Argument to prove this to be a Prophecy of the Meſſias is the unanimous Opinion of many of the ancient Rabbies and Doctors of the Jews before, and about, our Saviour's time, who all acknowledge
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107594:20"/>this whole Chapter, together with the latter end of the former, to be a Prophecy of the Meſſias. And therefore, if the modern Jews will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as much, they differ as much from their own Writers as from us; and no reaſon can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for their ſo doing, but their obſtinate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that will not ſuffer them to apply any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Scripture to the Meſſias, that ſeems to be inconſiſtent with worldly Pomp and Grandeur. Thus I have proved to you, that our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſias from theſe two Circumſtances, the time when he came into the world, and the manner how. The ſame truth may be yet further evinced from the reaſon and end of his coming; but this I ſhall leave until another opportunity.</p>

               <p>YE may remember that when formerly I began to handle this portion of Scripture, I laid down this Propoſition as the Foundation of my Diſcourſe, That our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſias, whom God hath long ſince ſent forth into the world; and that none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be expected. This I undertook to prove chiefly by theſe Arguments with which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle furniſhes us here in my Text, taken from the Conſideration of the time when, the manner how, and the end wherefore he came into World. The two former of theſe Circumſtances (the time when, and the manner how, our Saviour came into the World) I have already handled; and in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it have ſufficiently cleared the truth of this Propoſition, That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſias: but to make it yet more evident, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains one Circumſtance more to be conſidered; and that is the reaſon and end of his coming, which the Apoſtle compriſes in theſe words, <hi>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:107594:21"/>
               <p>It was not for nothing that ſo great a perſon as the Meſſias was to come into the World. No, he had a mighty work to do, which none was able to perform but himſelf: for he was to interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Divine Vengeance and Sin, which is its proper Object; to redeem all Mankind from the Curſe of the Law, to which we were become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and to reconcile us again unto God, and to purchaſe for us the adoption of Sons. This was a work worthy of the Meſſias, and what the Scriptures plainly foretold that he ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh: and that he might effect it, it was neceſſary, Firſt, That he ſhould moſt fully and clearly reveal to us the whole Will of God concerning us, and that he ſhould inſtruct and teach us how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves acceptably in his ſight: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he ſhould make an atonement for our Sins, and ſatisfie the Juſtice of God incenſed againſt us, by our Diſobedience: And thirdly, That he ſhould aſſiſt and defend us againſt all the attempts of our ſpiritual Enemies, and furniſh us with means ſufficient for the working out our Salvation. And accordingly we find him repreſented in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, ſometimes as a Prophet that ſhould in a more eminent manner, than any that ever were before, or ſhall be after him, publiſh and declare the Will of God. This God himſelf foretold unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Deut. 18.18. <hi>I will raiſe them up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all that I ſhall command him. And it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever will not hearken unto my words which he ſhall ſpeak in my Name, I will require it of him.</hi> Sometimes we find him repreſented as a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107594:22"/>Prieſt that ſhould make an atonement for the Sins of his People. So Pſal. 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi> And wherein his prieſtly Office chiefly conſiſted the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> informs us (chap. 53.) He was to <hi>pour out his ſoul unto death,</hi> to be <hi>an offering for ſin;</hi> to be <hi>numbred with the tranſgreſſours;</hi> to <hi>bear the ſin of many;</hi> and <hi>to make interceſſion for the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.</hi> And ſometimes we find him to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a King reigning with ſoveraign Power and Authority in a Kingdom that ſhould have no end. So Pſal 2.6, 8. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my holy hill of Sion. Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> Thus it was neceſſary, that the Meſſias ſhould be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in order to the accompliſhing the great Work of our Redemption. Since by Nature we are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of the Will of God, and deſtitute of all ſaving Knowledge, it was neceſſary that he ſhould be a Prophet ſent from Heaven to reveal it unto us. Since by Sin we were become Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto God, it was neceſſary that he ſhould be a Prieſt, to make Reconciliation and Interceſſion for us. And ſince we were to engage in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous War, to fight againſt Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Adverſaries far ſtronger and mightier than our ſelves, that with all their force continually withſtand us in our way to Heaven, and that had already enſlaved us all under their accurſed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny by the Diſ-obedience of our firſt Parents; it was neceſſary that he ſhould be a mighty King, endued with Power from on high, to aſſert our Liberty, and to ſubdue and diſcomfit our Enemies
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107594:22"/>before us. All theſe Qualifications, I ſay, were neceſſarily required in the Meſſias, and all are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſcribed unto him in the Old Teſtament: Now that our bleſſed Saviour did come into the World for this very end, for which the Prophets foretold that the Meſſias ſhould come, and that he was moſt eminently qualified in the ſame manner as they foretold he ſhould be, is moſt clearly evident in the account which the holy Evangeliſts and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the New Teſtament have given us of him.</p>
               <p>Firſt he came for that very end for which the Meſſias was to come, which (as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks) was to <hi>finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs;</hi> which is the ſame in effect which the Apoſtle ſaith here, in my Text, <hi>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> That this was the end of our Saviour's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only my Text, but almoſt every page of the New Teſtament aſſures us. <hi>The ſon of man,</hi> ſaith our Saviour of himſelf, <hi>is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> Luk. 19.10. and Matth. 20.28. <hi>The ſon of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſome for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſome for all, to be teſtified in due time,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5, 6. I need not inſiſt any more upon this Point, than which nothing is more evident in all the Scriptures. For <hi>this is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> The end of all his Sermons, of all his Miracles, of his moſt holy Life and heavenly Doctrine, of his moſt meritorious
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107594:23"/>Death and Paſſion, of his moſt glorious and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Reſurrection and Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of his moſt gracious Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, and of his continual Interceſſion for us at the right hand of God, was <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Thus ye ſee the end of our bleſſed Saviour's coming into the world, is both by himſelf and his Apoſtles plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the very ſame for which the Meſſias was to come. But ſtill this is not ſufficient: for one that was but an Impoſtor might impudently avouch himſelf to be the Meſſias, and go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world that he came for this very end. But it was neceſſary that he that did come for it indeed, and did truly accompliſh it, ſhould bring with him, as it were, credential Letters from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to aſſure the world that he was truly and really ſent by God upon ſo great an Embaſſy. And that he did do ſo is evident beyond all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Goſpel. All thoſe eminent Offices which the Prophets in the Old Teſtament aſcribe unto the Meſſias, he undertook and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a tittle, and was both a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King in all reſpects incomparably beyond what ever the world either did or ſhall behold.</p>
               <p>Firſt he was <hi>a Prophet mighty in deed and word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and all the people.</hi> His Doctrine was moſt Divine and Heavenly, far ſurpaſſing what had been formerly delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and agreeable to what they foretold ſhould be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Meſſias. Though it is moſt true, that the Religion which was taught by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets had God himſelf for its Author, and therefore could not chuſe but be good; yet it is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107594:23"/>certain that it was a far more imperfect Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine Will, than what was afterwards to be made by the Meſſias, who was to eſtabliſh a Religion, unto which not only the Jews, but all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould be obliged to ſubmit, or periſh upon their refuſal of it. For the proof of this I might produce many places out of the Writings of the Prophets; but the beginning of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for all. <hi>Behold my ſervant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth: I have put my ſpirit upon him; he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and the ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench: He ſhall bring forth judgment unto truth. He ſhall not fail nor be diſcouraged, till he have ſet judgment in the earth: and the iſles ſhall wait for his law.</hi> By this one paſſage, which is a plain Prophecy of the Meſſias, it is manifeſt that he was to be the greateſt Prophet that ever ſhould come into the world; an Elect and choſen Servant of God, in whom he delighted in a peculiar manner, above all the reſt of Mankind; one upon whom he would pour out his Spirit without meaſure, <hi>and anoint with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows;</hi> one that was not only to <hi>raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael,</hi> but was alſo to be <hi>a light to the Gentiles, and ſalvation unto the end of the earth,</hi> filling it all, even the Iſles as well as the Continent, <hi>full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.</hi> Now that our bleſſed Saviour was ſuch a Prophet as this, for greater than all the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, even than <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, is manifeſt in the Evangelical Hiſtory, both from the Doctrine which as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107594:24"/>he taught, and from the Miracles which as a Prophet he wrought for the Confirmation of it. As for his Doctrine, whoſoever reads it muſt needs acknowledge that it contains a far more perfect and full Revelation of the Divine Will, than what was delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, in regard both of Commands and Promiſes. All his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Commands were ſuch as highly became the infinite goodneſs of God to give unto us, for the refining and perfecting our Nature, and fitting us to partake of that Happineſs for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned us. All thoſe ſeemingly venial Vices and Imperfections connived at in the Moſaical Law were made capital Crimes, and ſtrictly forbidden, upon pain of Damnation, by the Law of Chriſt. All the falſe Gloſſes, and corrupt Doctrines of the Scribes and Phariſees, he hath utterly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned as groſs Hypocriſie: and by his Law <hi>whoſoever looks on a woman to luſt after her is</hi> already become <hi>an adulterer;</hi> whoſo haſtily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches his Brother as a Fool doth thereby bring himſelf in Danger of Hell-fire; he that hates his Brother is a murderer; he that loves not his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is guilty of an high breach of Chriſtian Charity, even ſo as to deprive himſelf of the love of God. In a word, he hath commanded us to <hi>be perfect, even as our Father which is in heaven is perfect,</hi> not only with outward, but with inward Purity: for his Law reaches not only our Hands, but our Tongues, and our Hearts; and he hath told us expreſly that not only for our Actions, but alſo for every idle word, and every ſinful thought, we ſhall give an account at the Day of Judgment. And as the Precepts and Commands of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our far exceed thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107594:24"/>ſo likewiſe hath he enforced the performance of them with the Promiſe of a far more glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the obedient, and the threatning of a far more dreadful Puniſhment to the Tranſgreſſors, than any mentioned in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And all this he did with far greater Authority, as one that was impowered with a higher Commiſſion, than <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. Whatſoever they taught, they taught in the name of God, uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their words with this Preface, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi> but our bleſſed Saviour, though what he taught was moſt truly the Word and Will of God, which he was ſent into the world to reveal unto us; yet, as one that knew that in him, it <hi>was no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> he delivers it not in God's Name, but in his own; <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> throughout all the Goſpels. And as our Saviour's Doctrine ſurpaſſes that of <hi>Moſes</hi> in its Excellency and Purity; ſo doth it likewiſe in its Extent and Univerſality: and whereas the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was publiſhed only to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that of Chriſt extends it ſelf to all Mankind, whereſoever diſperſed over the face of the whole Earth, <hi>Goye,</hi> ſaith he to his Apoſtles, <hi>into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark 16.15. And that nothing might be wanting to ſatisfie us, that he was indeed a Prophet ſent by God on purpoſe, in his Name, and by his Authority, to teach this Doctrine, he confirmed and ratified it with the broad Seal of Heaven, with innumerable and moſt aſtoniſhing Miracles, than which, greater or more certain Teſtimony God himſelf cannot give us for the Confirmation of any Truth. Theſe Miracles of his were ſo many and ſo wonderful, that more could not be expected from the Meſſias, by the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107594:25"/>Confeſſion of many of the Jews that believed on him: <hi>When Chriſt cometh,</hi> ſay they, <hi>will he do more miracles than theſe which this man hath done?</hi> Joh. 7.31. Even the Rulers of the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as the common People were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he did work Miracles; and for that very reaſon they conſpired againſt him, and put him to Death, as we read they did upon his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead. Joh. 11.47. <hi>Then gathered the chief Prieſts and Phariſees a council, and ſaid, What do we? for this man doth many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans ſhall come and take away both our place and nation.</hi> To theſe Miracles we may add alſo his Predictions of future Events, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange and unexpected; and yet all punctually fulfilled to a tittle, in the very ſame manner and order as he foretold they ſhould be. All theſe things (which I only name, preſuming them to be well known to all that live within the ſound of the Goſpel) evidently demonſtrate our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be far the greateſt Prophet that ever came into the world; even ſuch an one as all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before him foretold that the Meſſias ſhould be.</p>
               <p>And as he was a Prophet, ſo he was alſo a Prieſt, as eminent in that Office as in the other, Superior to all thoſe of the Aaronical Prieſthood, even to <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf, who, as well as his Succeſſors; was but a Type of our great High-Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt. And that he was ſuch a Prieſt as this is frequently declared in the New Teſtament, and moſt clearly demonſtrated by his performing the Offices belonging to ſuch a Prieſt, which are eſpecially theſe two. Firſt to offer up unto God a moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107594:25"/>perfect, and ſufficient Sacrifice, to ſatisfie his Juſtice, and to make an atonement for the Sins of all Mankind. Secondly, to appear continually in the Preſence of God, making moſt powerful and effectual Interceſſion for all true Believers. That he hath already performed one of theſe Offices, and that he doth ſtill perform the other, we are aſſured by all the holy Pen-men, whoſe buſineſs it was to give us a true and faithful account of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Firſt, he hath offered up unto God ſuch a Sacrifice as he himſelf required, with which his Juſtice is fully ſatisfied, and his Wrath appeaſed. And this was that Oblation of himſelf, of his own moſt precious Body and Blood, when <hi>he poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> to be <hi>an offering for ſin,</hi> upon the Altar of the Croſs. <hi>Chriſt, being come an High-Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us,</hi> Hebr. 9.11, 12. And, without looking any further, that one Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> may ſatisfie us in this Point, the main Deſign of it being to convince the Jews that Jeſus Chriſt was ſuch an High-Prieſt as we are ſpeaking of, <hi>Who was once offered to bear the ſins of many; and who ſhall appear unto them that look for him the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation.</hi> Secondly, as our bleſſed Saviour hath offered this holy, ſpotleſs, and moſt acceptable Sacrifice of himſelf unto God for us, ſo doth he likewiſe continually intercede for us at his right hand, pleading the merits of his moſt precious Death and Paſſion in our behalf, that we thereby may be delivered from the Curſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107594:26"/>of the Law, and receive the adoption of Sons. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Hebr. 9.24. and Hebr. 7.25. He tells us, <hi>That he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> So Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us. And if any man ſin,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. Thus then it is evident, that our bleſſed Saviour is by the holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles (that have given us a true and faithful account of him) repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be, as great an High-Prieſt as it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Meſſias could be; for who can be higher than he that is ſet down at the right hand of God?</p>
               <p>And this naturally brings me to the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his laſt and higheſt Office, which is that of a King: For ſurely he that is exalted unto the right hand of God, can be no leſs than a King in the higheſt Degree, a King of Saints and Angels a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords Let the Jews perſwade themſelves what they pleaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the greatneſs of the Kingdom of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Meſſias, whom they fondly dream is yet to come into the world, though they cannot deny that the time prefixed for his coming by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is long ſince paſt, yet a greater King they cannot imagine him to be than we know, and are fully aſſured by the unanimous Teſtimony of moſt faithful and unexceptionable Witneſſes, that our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107594:26"/>bleſſed Saviour already is; who is, and ever ſhall be, <hi>a King upon Gods holy hill of Sion,</hi> whom he hath exalted, and <hi>ſet at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come, and put all things under his feet, and given him to be the head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.20, 21, 22. That our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was to be ſuch a King as this the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> expreſly foretold to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at his Conception, Luk. 1.31. <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in thy womb, and bring forth a ſon, and ſhalt call his name Jeſus. He ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the ſon of the higheſt: and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever; and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> Which words plainly imply that he was not to be a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral King, a King of this World, whoſe Kings and Kingdoms ſhall all periſh and come to an end; but a ſpiritual King of a Kingdom which is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Such a King as this our Lord owned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be. <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom,</hi> ſaith he to his Diſciples, <hi>as my father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and ſit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 22.29, 30. A King even <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf ſeemed poſitively to declare him by the Superſcription upon his Croſs, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth the King of the Jews;</hi> which he would by no means alter at the requeſt of the chief Prieſts. Such a King he moſt powerfully demonſtrated himſelf to be by his triumphant Reſurrection from the Dead. Such a King he yet more fully
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107594:27"/>proved himſelf to be by his moſt glorious Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven. Having firſt told his Diſciples that <hi>all power is given unto him in heaven and in earth,</hi> he ſhews them the truth of it by ocular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, viſibly in their ſight aſcending up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, to take Poſſeſſion of his eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſending moreover two Angels to comfort them, and aſſure them that he, <hi>the ſame Jeſus, which was taken up from them into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as they had ſeen him go into heaven,</hi> Act. 1.11. And after all this, according to his Promiſe, as a King that was <hi>aſcended on high, that had led captivity captive, and received gifts for men,</hi> he beſtows upon them a gift fit for the King of Heaven, to beſtow upon his choiceſt Favourites, even that of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Day of Pentecoſt, thereby, to the aſtoniſhment of all that beheld them, impowering them to work Miracles and to ſpeak with Tongues, in order to the accompliſhing that great work about which he employed them; which was to proclaim him over all the World to be ſuch a King, ſuch a Saviour, and to gather him a Church out of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, declaring that unto all thoſe that will believe and obey him, and receive him for their Soveraign Lord and King, he will moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be <hi>the authour of eternal ſalvation,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them from the Curſe of the Law, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for them <hi>the adoption of ſons;</hi> and that, when at the laſt day he ſhall come again in the Glory of his Father, to judge the world in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, he ſhall then as an omnipotent King, whoſe Power nothing can reſiſt, execute Vengeance upon all his Enemies, and reward all his faithful and obedient Subjects with everlaſting Felicity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107594:27"/>them into his heavenly Kingdom, there to Reign together with him in Glory, <hi>as Kings and Prieſts unto God for ever;</hi> thus I have proved to you I hope beyond all Contradiction (except ſuch as proceeds from wilful and obſtinate Malice, or notorious Ignorance or Prejudice, which muſt needs be weak and groundleſs) that our bleſſed Saviour is the true Meſſias, whom God hath long ſince ſent forth into the World, and that none other is to be expected by us: and this I have done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my propounded method, chiefly by thoſe Arguments with which my Text furniſhes us, taken from the Conſideration of the time when, the manner how, and the reaſon and end wherefore he came into the World: And in the doing of it I have inſiſted more or leſs upon all the material Circumſtances mentioned by the Prophets, as it were ſo many infallible Notes and Characters, by which the Meſſias was to be known and diſcerned from all the reſt of Mankind, and ſhewed you that every one of them is exactly fulfilled to a tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in the perſon of our Saviour; and that it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible, that they ever ſhould agree to any other perſon whatſoever, the time prefixed by God for the coming of the Meſſias being long ſince paſt; ſo that it is now beyond the Power of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence it ſelf to recal it. If then our bleſſed Saviour be the true Meſſias whom God, out of his great love to Mankind, hath ſent into the World to reconcile it unto himſelf, <hi>redeem us</hi> from the Curſe of <hi>the Law, that we might receive the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſons,</hi> and <hi>that whoſoever believes in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> woe be to all thoſe that receive him not as ſuch <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> For <hi>there is none other
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107594:28"/>name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> but that of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. In him therefore let us ſtedfaſtly believe, <hi>committing the keeping of our ſouls unto him in well-doing, as unto a faithful</hi> Redeemer that is both mighty and willing to ſave us; owning him to be our great Prophet, that hath revealed unto us the whole Will of God, by our firm Belief of all his Divine Doctrine; owning him to be our great High Prieſt, who, by the Sacrifice of himſelf once offered, hath made an atonement for our Sins, and ever liveth to make Interceſſion unto God for us, by our relying wholly upon his merits for Salvation: owning him to be our Soveraign, our Almighty Lord and King, able to defend and protect us in this World, and to reward us in the next, by yielding a conſtant, impartial and univerſal Obedience to all his moſt holy Laws and Commandments. Thus if we own him here before men, he will hereafter own us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father which is in Heaven; and, when thoſe that have rejected him ſhall be covered with eternal Shame and Confuſion, blacker than that darkneſs into which they muſt be for ever baniſhed from the Preſence of the Lord, he ſhall cloath us with the glorious Robe of his own righteouſneſs, and admit us into the everlaſting Happineſs of his heavenly Kingdom, to thoſe Pleaſures which are at God's right hand for evermore.</p>

               <p>INgratitude is a Crime ſo baſe and unnatural, ſo repugnant to the Dictates of reaſon, that no Man of a generous Spirit can endure to be guilty of it. The ſlighteſt Favour we receive from any of our Friends, if it proceed from an hearty Intention to do us good, deſerves at leaſt our kind acceptance and thanks. But ſuch a Signal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Obligation may be laid upon us even by an earthly Benefactor, that we can do no leſs than devote our lives and fortunes to his Service, and think it little enough for an acknowledgment of his kindneſs. But ſtill the greateſt Benefits that we can receive from the hand of Man, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of the leaſt of thoſe which we receive daily from the hand of God, from whom alone comes <hi>every good and perfect gift.</hi> Every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his is ineſtimable; that we breath his Air, that we drink his Water, that we tread upon his Earth, that we ſeed upon his Creatures, that we behold his Light, that he created us and brought
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107594:29"/>us out of the dark Abyſs, when before we had no Being, and that he ſtill preſerves and protects us: theſe Mercies ſufficiently declare, that all that we have, all that we are (except what we made our ſelves by ſin) we have and are from him; and that therefore he moſt juſtly Challenges a right, both to our Bodies and our Souls: all that we can do or ſuffer for him is inconſiderable, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the good we have received from him. And yet all theſe Mercies which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are nothing to that which is behind, his Redemption of us by the Death of his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, whereas otherwiſe we had been loſt and undone for ever. This ſurely was the utmoſt Effort of infinite Love and Goodneſs; a Mercy which the more it is conſidered, the more it will be admired, and will be the eternal Subject of our wonder, as well as of our Praiſe and Thankſgiving in Heaven. And now what doth God require of us, as an acknowledgment of this unconceivable Favour? Not <hi>thouſands of rams,</hi> nor <hi>ten thouſands of rivers of oyl:</hi> 'tis only this, that we will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him that hath redeemed us. <hi>For ye are bought,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Which words contain theſe three things. 1. God's Mercy towards us; <hi>he hath bought us with a Price,</hi> and ſo we are his by right of Purchaſe. 2. The Duty which thereupon he requires us to perform to him; <hi>we muſt therefore glorifie him.</hi> 3. The manner how; we muſt do it <hi>in our Body and in our Spirit,</hi> foraſmuch as he hath redeemed and purchaſed both of them, and both are his. <hi>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107594:29"/>
               <p>Let us take a view of God's mercy towards us firſt; and when we have had a true Proſpect of that we ſhall be the better enabled to diſcern how great an Obligation lies upon us to perform that Duty, which thereupon the Apoſtle in the name of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us. To take a view of God's mercy is an hard Task, though it is a very pleaſant one; to take a full view of it is indeed impoſſible for either Men or Angels, ſince his mercy is, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is, infinite: and the greateſt inſtance of his mercy, which the Scripture makes mention of is that which he hath ſhewed to Mankind. 'Tis true he created Creatures of an higher order and nobler nature than Man, even the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Light whom he ordained to be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Attendants about his Throne, and advanced to the higheſt Honour and Felicity in his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom. Theſe, as they were the Firſt-born of the Creation, ſo they received a double Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their Creator; and whereas he made Man only the Lord of his Footſtool here below, he admitted them to be Inhabitants of his Palace above, and aſſigned to them everlaſting Manſions of Light and Glory. Thus far God's Love and Goodneſs was greater towards the Angels than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man. But when ſome of theſe (once glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) Creatures rebelled againſt their Creator, and fell from their happy Station, God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to admit of no Mediator to intercede for their Pardon, but left them to reap the fruit of their Folly, and condemned them for ever to that remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Miſery into which their ſin had moſt deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunged them. But with Man he dealt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for when he alſo by tranſgreſſing that eaſie Command which was given him in Paradiſe, had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107594:30"/>incurred the ſame Condemnation with thoſe apoſtate Spirits, God was pleaſed here to mingle Mercy with Juſtice, and to order the matter ſo, that tho' he did both pronounce and execute the Sentence of Death upon him, which he had threatned in caſe of his diſobedience, yet he made even Death it ſelf a Happineſs to him, as well as a Puniſhment, a gate of Life and Immortality, and an inlet into a far more glorious Paradiſe than that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had forfeited. This was a Mercy beyond all Expectation, above the thoughts of Men or Angels to comprehend, that whereas he left no place of Repentance to the fallen Angels, but hat <hi>reſerved them in everlaſting chains under darkneſs unto the judgment of the great day,</hi> yet he had pity on Man though a Creature of an inferior Nature, ſo that even before he pronounced againſt him the Sentence of Death, he publiſhed a ſhort Goſpel of Peace and Reconciliation, and aſſured him, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpents head.</hi> Thus did God utterly confound the Malice of Satan, and cauſe his miſchief to return upon his own pate; his aim was to bring Man into the ſame Perdition with himſelf, without any hopes of recovery; that ſo he might inſult over him as his Captive and Vaſſal for ever: but ſo far was God from ſuffering him to enjoy the Pleaſure of ſuch a Triumph, that he preſently declares that that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Victory that he had gained over Man, ſhould end in his own eternal overthrow; that though he had diſpoſſeſſed the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> of his earthly Paradiſe, yet he would at his appointed time ſend another <hi>Adam</hi> that ſhould conduct all the race of Mankind, that would believe in him and obey him, to take Poſſeſſion of thoſe glorious Manſions from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107594:30"/>whence he and his rebellious Companions were fallen; a Man whom all the Angels of God ſhould worſhip; a Man that ſhould trample Satan under his feet; a Man that ſhould be one with God; at <hi>whoſe name every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth,</hi> a Man that ſhould <hi>have the keys of hell and of death,</hi> who having <hi>lead captivity captive,</hi> and <hi>ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led principalities and powers</hi> ſhould aſcend into the higheſt Heavens, <hi>and ſit on the right hand of God, Angels and Authorities, and Powers being made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him.</hi> But though God was reſolved, that though Man was thus miſerably loſt, and ſold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Satan, to the utter confuſion and aſtoniſhment of him that had wrought his ruin, he ſhould be redeemed and reſtored again; yet this was no eaſie Task even to Omnipotence it ſelf, but God was forced to be at the Expence, both of pains and charge to effect it. The Creation of Man, and of the whole World, coſt him no trouble at all: <hi>For he ſpake, and it was done; he commanded and it ſtood faſt:</hi> but Man's Redemption coſt the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt price that Heaven had to give; <hi>not corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but the precious blood of</hi> the Son of God, <hi>as of a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi> That Man might live, God himſelf was fain to become Man, and to die for the ſatisfaction of the Divine Juſtice. A Myſtery ſo great, ſo incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, that though nothing be more plainly and fully revealed in the holy Scripture, yet many (who notwithſtanding call themſelves Chriſtians) will not be perſwaded to believe it, moſt impudently and ungratefully <hi>denying the Lord that bought them, and bringing upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> Thus you ſee the ranſome that was paid for us; we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107594:31"/>
                  <hi>were bought with a price,</hi> a Price ineſtimable, a Price infinite, a Price greater than which the mercy of God could not give, and leſs than which his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice would not accept. The greatneſs of this Price ſufficiently intimates the great reaſon that there was, that ſuch a Price as this ſhould be paid. For certainly God who doth nothing in vain would never have been at ſuch a vaſt Expence as this, had not there been great occaſion for it: and ſo there was upon all accounts. The Wiſdom, the Mercy, the Juſtice, all the Attributes of God at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this Price, and all at once were glorified by the Payment of it far more than by the Creation of the World. The malice and cruelty of Satan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that this Price ſhould be paid for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and above all the Miſery of Man required it for his Redemption. Though ſome of the Angels fell yet others (and doubtleſs the greateſt part of them) kept their Station; and ſo God was pleaſed to puniſh the one for their Rebellion, and to reward the other for their Fidelity. But with us the Caſe was otherwiſe: all the whole race of Man was loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> inſomuch that not one of his Poſterity could plead Exemption, either from Death or Hell. And had God ſuffered them to have been all thus loſt without any hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; Satan would have had too great cauſe to triumph, and blaſphemouſly to boaſt that he had baffled the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, having utterly ruined and deſtroyed Man the chief work of all the viſible Creation, a Creature highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God and precious in his ſight, whom he plainly declared that he deſigned for great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ends, firſt by taking (as it were) ſpecial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Advice about his Creation, and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107594:31"/>upon him his own glorious Image, and making him Lord of all the Creatures upon Earth. <hi>Let us make man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in our own image, after our likeneſs: and let them have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattel, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth,</hi> Gen. 1.26. It was therefore a Stratagem worthy of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, to reſcue ſo conſiderable a part of the Creation out of the paw of that roaring Lyon who thought to have devoured it, and to make the wicked malice of Satan contrary to his Expectation, tend to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing not only of his own Miſery, but of Man's Felicity. Laſtly, the deplorable Condition of fallen Man required that this Price ſhould be paid for his Redemption: and certainly it was none of the leaſt Motives that induced God to lay it down. Our Saviour himſelf ſeems to intimate that it was the chief. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. In the proſecution of this Point I might be very large: for I ſhould inſiſt firſt upon that bleſſed Eſtate that Man enjoyed at his firſt Creation in innocence; the Conſideration of which would give us a truer proſpect of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, which he afterwards brought upon himſelf by his diſobedience: for none can be ſo miſerable as they that were once happy: and laſtly, I ſhould ſhew you how great Glory this price hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us, which would appear likewiſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after the ſight of that Miſery from which it hath redeemed us: for reſt is moſt welcome to the weary, eaſe and liberty is by none ſo highly valued
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107594:32"/>as by thoſe perſons that have been long detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Bondage and Slavery, and Joy and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doubles its ſweetneſs to them that have drunk deepeſt of ſorrow. But <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things.</hi> How can we that are all conceived and born in Sin apprehend the Happineſs of the ſtate of Innocence! Who is able to deſcribe the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the infernal Pit, or to tell what it is to lie in Chains of darkneſs, <hi>exiled</hi> for ever <hi>from the Divine Providence!</hi> Who can aſcend into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hill of the Lord, that he may give us an account of thoſe Pleaſures which are at God's right hand for evermore! Even St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, tho' he was bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> and abounded with Learning and Eloquence, yet wanted words to tell us, what he heard and ſaw when he was caught up into the third Heaven, and could ſay no more of that wonderful Viſion than that he heard <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, words, or things unutterable. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place he tells us, that <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> No, theſe Subjects are all of them too great either for our tongue to expreſs, or for our thoughts to comprehend. Let it ſuffice us then to know in ſhort, that whereas by Sin we had rendered our ſelves obnoxious to the greateſt Miſery that could poſſibly befal us, had ſold our ſelves to be Slaves and Vaſſals of Satan, to be the moſt forlorn Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the eternal Scorn, and Inſolence, and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Devil and his Angels; God in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy hath been pleaſed, by paying an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable price for our Ranſome, even the precious Blood of his only begotten Son, to redeem us out of this Bondage <hi>into the glorious liberty of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107594:32"/>children of God.</hi> He hath bought our Bodies from the everlaſting torment of thoſe Flames which never ſhall be quenched, and our Souls from the gnawing of that Worm which ſhall never die, to be the Temples of his holy Spirit here, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be <hi>fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſhold of God</hi> in the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem. We are bought with a price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hath God thus bought us with ſo invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Price, out of ſo dreadful Miſery, unto ſo unſpeakable Felicity? What returns then ought we to make unto him of praiſe and thanks for ſuch infinite Mercy! How can we chuſe but ſtand aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and break out into the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him!</hi> What was Man being in Honour, when he was but a degree lower than the Angels, that God ſhould regard him above the reſt of his Creatures; that he ſhould <hi>make him have dominion over the works of his hands, and put all things under his feet?</hi> But when through his own fault he fell into Diſhonour, and became like the Beaſts that periſh, what was he then, or what elſe could he expect, but that God ſhould caſt him for ever out of his Preſence as the filth of the Creation? And when after all this he meets with Mercy inſtead of Vengeance, when God himſelf becomes his Advocate inſtead of his Enemy, and inſtead of condemning him to Hell, ſends his only begotten Son to purchaſe for him the adoption of Sons, and to make him more than ever the Darling and Favourite of Heaven; what Teſtimony of gratitude ought we to ſhew for ſo incomprehenſible Love? What can we ſay, what can we do, to this Preſerver of men? The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107594:33"/>Apoſtle tells us in the following words of my Text: we muſt glorifie him. <hi>Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit which are Gods.</hi> And ſo I paſs from God's mercy to our Duty. <hi>He hath bought us with a price, we muſt therefore glorifie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How eaſie an acknowledgment of how great a Mercy! What could God do more for us than he did? and what could we offer to him, even for the leaſt of his Benefits, leſs than what he requires of us for the greateſt? The ſlighteſt Favour that we receive from the bountiful hand of God, ſurely moſt juſtly Challenges from us the Sacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving: and he requires no more of us when he hath given us the higheſt Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Love that ever he ſhewed to any of his Creatures: when he hath redeemed us from the loweſt Abyſs of miſery, into which our Nature could ſink, unto the moſt glorious and unſpeakable Felicity, of which it could be capable; and hath done all this by paying for our Ranſome, the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt precious Jewel that was to be found in all the Treaſury of Heaven, ſtill he asks but the ſame thing of us that he did before, <hi>viz. that we will glorifie him.</hi> And is it poſſible that there ſhould be any man found that can refuſe to perform ſo reaſonable and pleafant a Service as this to ſo great a Benefactor? Is it poſſible that when the bleſſed Son of God, hath for our Salvation ſhed his moſt precious Blood, laid down his Life, <hi>and poured out his</hi> righteous <hi>ſoul unto death,</hi> and <hi>made it an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our ſins,</hi> we ſhould after all this think much to offer unto him <hi>the calves of our lips,</hi> and refuſe to ſing an Hymn of praiſe to our Redeemer, ſaying with the Saints in the Revelation, <hi>Salvation, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107594:33"/>glory, and honour, and power unto the Lord our God?</hi> Yes it is ſo poſſible, that this black Ingratitude ſhould be found amongſt us, that the greateſt part of Mankind are guilty of it. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are there amongſt the Sons of men, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>glorifying God in their body, and in their ſpirit,</hi> even in the very face of the glorious light of the Goſpel that ſhines about them, againſt all the ſtrength of Reaſon, the univerſal Conſent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in all Ages, and the ſecret Reluctancies, and dreadful Checks of their own Conſciences impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deny both the being of God, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of their own Souls? How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are there more, who, though they own the name of Chriſtians, and acknowledge one eternal and omnipotent God, yet inſtead of <hi>glorifying God</hi> becauſe they <hi>are bought with a price,</hi> againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the Apoſtle in my Text, and the concurrent Senſe and Harmony of the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, abſolutely deny that there was ever any ſuch purchaſe made, diſowning both the Divinity of Chriſt, and the ſatisfaction of his Sufferings? As if the God of Truth had ſtudied to impoſe upon the credulity of Mankind, and when he tells us moſt plainly in his word, that he hath <hi>purchaſed his Church with his own blood,</hi> that <hi>we are bought with a price,</hi> and that our bleſſed <hi>Saviour gave himſelf a ranſome for all,</hi> and that not only <gap reason="foreign">

How many thouſands are there yet, even amongſt us Chriſtians, who, inſtead of <hi>glorifying God in their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107594:34"/>body and in their ſpirit,</hi> openly diſhonour him in both, <hi>glory in their ſhame,</hi> and by their wicked and profligate Lives <hi>crucifie afreſh the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>blaſpheme that worthy Name by which they are called?</hi> Laſtly, how many Myriads, how many Millions are there beſides all theſe, that yet ſit in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of Death? Who never heard of the glad tidings of the Goſpel, nor have had their underſtandings enlightened, and their hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and awakened out of the deadly Lethargy of Pagan Ignorance, and Superſtition, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, by the benign and ſalutiferous influence of the Son of righteouſneſs? Who inſtead of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God, give away his Glory to his greateſt Enemy, and do Sacrifice unto the Devil? Theſe are ſad Conſiderations; that infinite Mercy and Love ſhould be received with ſuch prodigious Scorn and Ingratitude; that ſo invaluable a price as God hath given for us ſhould be paid in vain for the greateſt part of Mankind; that but a ſmall and inconſiderable number in compariſon of the whole Race of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould <hi>waſh their robes and make them white in the blood of that Lamb</hi> that was ſlain for the ſins of the whole World, and was a Sacrifice every way ſufficient to make an atonement for them all. Who can reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things without ſorrow?</p>
               <p>Since then the Caſe is thus with us, that moſt of us are liable to loſe the benefit of this Price, by neglecting to perform this Duty of glorifying God, to which it hath indiſpenſably obliged us, let us briefly conſider the reaſonableneſs and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this Duty (that we may be the more encouraged unto it) upon theſe following Accounts. Firſt, this Duty of glorifying God is exceeding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107594:34"/>reaſonable, foraſmuch as God himſelf is the only Object in the world, that is in, and for himſelf glorious and adorable. It is a Maxim in Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, that the King is the Fountain of Honour: how much more then is that Prerogative peculiar unto God, <hi>By whom Kings reign, and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Juſtice?</hi> From whom all Honour, both in Heaven and Earth is derived, and unto whom it returns again, and centers it ſelf as the Rivers in the Ocean. When we look upon the Moon ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its full ſtrength and beauty, we cannot but confeſs that its Light is very pleaſant and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to behold: but it diminiſhes much from its Excellency, when we conſider that all its Luſtre is borrowed, and that ſhould the Sun withhold its influence, the other would be nothing elſe but a dark inviſible Globe. So likewiſe when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Angels and Archangels, and all the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Powers of Heaven that excel in Strength, and Goodneſs, and Holineſs; we muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that theſe are Creatures beyond all our thoughts happy and glorious: but when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further, that as great and good, and happy as they are, yet ſtill they are but Creatures, and that all theſe rich Endowments that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they owe to <hi>the father of ſpirits, from whom alone comes every good and perfect gift,</hi> all the Praiſe and Glory redounds ſolely to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator, <hi>Who makes his Angels ſpirits, and his Miniſters a flaming fire,</hi> and to whoſe Soveraign Will, and uncontrolable Power, the higheſt Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel is as ſubject and ſubſervient, as the moſt deſpicable Inſect that we trample under our Feet. Since therefore it is moſt plain, and undeniable that God is the only Object in the world that is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107594:35"/>in, and for himſelf glorious, and is the Spring and Fountain of Glory and Honour to all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that do in any meaſure participate of it, reaſon dictates to us (and we need enquire no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that it is our Duty to glorifie him; and that ſhould we do otherwiſe even the very ſtones under our feet might juſtly riſe up in Judgment againſt us and condemn us. Secondly, as God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Object that is in, and for himſelf glorious, and that in an infinite and incomprehenſible manner; ſo he created all things at the firſt for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his own Glory, and requires this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to be paid him by every one of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their reſpective Capacities. For any of the Creatures, even for the greateſt of them, to love himſelf above all things, or to make his own Glory and Honour the end of his Actions is Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is Injuſtice, is Sin, is ſuch fooliſh and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Pride, as caſt the fallen Angels out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Man out of Paradiſe. But for God to do thus is both wiſe and juſt; ſeeing that Wiſdom and Equity requires, that nothing leſs than infinite Perfection ſhould be the adequate Object of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love and Glory, and therefore it would be a manifeſt piece of Injuſtice (of which God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be capable) for him to give that Love or Glory to another, which is due to none elſe but himſelf alone. And accordingly he himſelf hath told us, that he never will do it; <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another,</hi> Iſa. 42.8. No, he hath reſerved it wholly to himſelf, and for the manifeſtation of it he hath created all things. So the four and twenty Elders confeſs. Rev. 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour, and power: for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107594:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi> The ultimate end of the whole Creation, was the Glory of the Creator. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſheweth his handy-work,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſ. 19.1. whoth at conſiders the certain and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motions of the celeſtial Bodies, can chuſe but extol and magnifie the Power and Wiſdom of that God that made them, ſaying with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Praiſe ye him, ſun and moon; praiſe him all ye ſtars of light. Let them praiſe the name of the Lord: for he commanded, and they were created. He hath alſo eſtabliſhed them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which ſhall not paſs?</hi> Neither were the Heavens only created for the Glory of God, but the Earth alſo declares the ſame, and his wonders are ſeen in the Deep. Even the mercileſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Sea obeys the Decree of him who hath <hi>ſhut it up with doors,</hi> and ſuffers its proud Waves to be bounded and checkt by the Sand. <hi>There go the ſhips, and there is that Leviathan whom he hath made to play therein.</hi> The Earth faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Task that was impoſed upon it at its firſt Creation, and ceaſes not to bring forth its fruit in its Seaſon; and the moſt inconſiderable Creature that it nouriſhes, even the ſmalleſt Fly, publiſhes the wiſdom and power of its Creator, as much as the greateſt Elephant. And who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that conſiders theſe things can chuſe but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Praiſe the Lord from the earth ye dragons, and all deeps: fire and hail, ſnow and vapour; ſtormy wind fulfilling his word. Mountains and all hills; fruitful trees and all cedars; beaſts and all cattel; creeping things and all fowl.</hi> And ſhall all theſe inferiour Creatures
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107594:36"/>daily laud and magnifie their Maker (as moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they do, while in their ſeveral Stations they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Commands) ſhall the little Birds warble out Hymns of Praiſe, and every Hedge produce a Quire to ſing an Hallelujah, and ſhall Man alone be ſilent? Man whom God himſelf <hi>hath crowned with glory and honour;</hi> whom he hath <hi>made to have dominion over the works of his hands, and hath put all things under his feet: all ſheep and oxen, yea, and the beaſts of the field; the fowl of the air, and the fiſh of the ſea, and whatſoever paſſeth through the paths of the ſeas?</hi> Man whom when he had loſt all this Honour; when Sin had laid both it, and himſelf together in the duſt, out of which they were both raiſed at the firſt, God was pleaſed by a Miracle of mercy to reſtore to Honour once more, nay to greater Honour than he had before, even to the Honour (if he forfeits it not again by his own monſtrous Ingratitude) of being made like unto the Angels in Heaven, of being <hi>numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of God, and having his lot among the ſaints?</hi> I ſay ſhall Man whom of all the reſt of his Creatures, God hath delighted moſt to Honour, be of all the reſt of the Creatures, the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and moſt backward to give Praiſe and Glory to God? Oh, whereſoever this Ingratitude be to be found, let it not be found amongſt us; but let us ſtill joyn with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Kings of the earth, and all people; princes and all judges of the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: Let them praiſe the name of the Lord: for his name only is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.</hi> Thirdly, that this Duty of glorifying God, is both reaſonable and neceſſary is evident, in as much as all Mankind,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107594:36"/>both good and bad, ſhall moſt certainly, one way or other, give glory to God. For the <hi>Lord</hi> will be <hi>King for ever, be the people never ſo</hi> tumultuous and <hi>unquiet:</hi> and though he be offended, <hi>and provoked,</hi> and blaſphemed <hi>every day,</hi> yet he is <hi>ſtrong</hi> as well as <hi>patient,</hi> and will one day vindicate his abuſed patience and longſuffering, and will <hi>exalt himſelf above the heavens, and his glory above all the earth.</hi> Then ſhall all thoſe fooliſh Wretches that refuſed to <hi>give unto the Lord the glory due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his name,</hi> and to celebrate the Praiſe of <hi>his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that endureth for ever,</hi> be forced by their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment to glorifie his Juſtice. For <hi>the glory of the Lord ſhall endure for ever: the Lord ſhall rejoyce in his works.</hi> For <hi>he hath made all things for himſelf,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> Prov. 16.4. Thus did God get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Honour, as well by puniſhing the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom he overthrew in the Sea, as by rewarding the obedience of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to whom he gave Power to command it. And thus at the end of all things, will he cauſe his Juſtice eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhine as bright and glorious below, even in the midſt of the infernal darkneſs, as his mercy ſhall above in the Regions of light and happineſs. And Oh how ſad, how dreadful will our Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be, if we neglect this great Salvation that is offered us; if notwithſtanding this wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that God hath wrought for us, we will again ſell our ſelves Slaves to Sin and Satan? And if but the taſting of a forbidden fruit brought Death into the world, and made all Mankind ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the eternal wrath of God, what Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is reſerved for them that tread under foot the Blood of his only begotten Son; that deſpiſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107594:37"/>the very height of his Love, and the utmoſt riches of his Mercy. Since then we muſt unavoidably glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie either the Mercy of God, or his Juſtice, let us chuſe rather to adore the former, than to be broken in pieces by the latter: for they that will not ſubmit to his gentle Government while he holds forth his golden Sceptre, ſhall be ſure to feel the Severity of his rod of Iron. Laſtly, (for I muſt not be tedious, though the Subject be ſo copious that I might heap up Arguments without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Since there is not the leaſt part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, excepting wicked Men and wicked Angels, but what ſets us an Example, and invites us to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Creator) this Duty of glorifying God is moſt highly reaſonable for us to perform while we are upon Earth, becauſe it will be our eternal Task if ever we come to Heaven. Thoſe glorious Manſions above reſound inceſſantly with Hymns of Praiſe unto the King of Saints, <hi>To whom all Angels cry aloud continually, the Heavous and all the powers therein, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbaoth. Heaven and earth are full of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of thy glory.</hi> If therefore we deſire to perform this Duty in the next Life, it is not only reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but neceſſary that we begin is in this. For certainly if we do not now tune our Voice to an Hallelujah, and practiſe the Muſick of Heaven while we are upon Earth, Candidates for a Place in the celeſtial Choire, we ſhall never be qualified to bear a part in that <hi>new Song,</hi> which is to be ſung before the throne of God, and <hi>none</hi> ſhall be able to <hi>learn it but the</hi> Saints, <hi>that are redeemed from the Earth.</hi> Let us therefore now, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more joyn with thoſe bleſſed Spirits, in glorifying our Almighty Creator, ſaying as our Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107594:37"/>us, (and with which words we will at preſent break off our Diſcourſe) <hi>Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the Company of Heaven, we laud and magnifie thy glorious Name, evermore prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee, and ſaying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hoſts, Heaven and Earth are full of thy Glory; Glory be to thee, O Lord moſt high.</hi>

               <p>THE reaſonableneſs of this Duty of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God, to which in theſe words the Apoſtle exhorts us, we have already ſeen; and indeed he muſt be blind that ſees it not, when the whole Creation joins unanimouſly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant performance of it, and every Corner of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Power, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of the Almighty Creatour. But though the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this Duty muſt needs be apparent to all Men that believe that there is a God (and they that believe not that, though they may ſeem to be Rational Creatures, are certainly moſt notorious Fools) yet all Men are not ſo clearly agreed how to perform this Duty: and that is the next thing that falls under our Conſideration, and the laſt Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to be handled in my Text, the manner how we muſt glorifie God; we muſt do it in our Body and in our Spirit, foraſmuch as he hath redeemed and purchaſed both of them, and both are his. <hi>For ye are bought with a price,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt glorifie God in our Spirit; that is, in our Soul: and in this all Parties are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed; even the very Quakers themſelves, the moſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107594:38"/>ſtupid and ſenſeleſs Fanaticks, that have ſurfeited upon Religion, and overwhelmed and oppreſſed their Reaſon by that very thing which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to refine and perfect it, will all of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that <hi>God</hi> is to be <hi>worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> and that their Soul ought to bow to him, though their Body be as inflexible as a Pillar of Marble. And indeed this is the chief and main thing that we are to take care of in the worſhip of God, that our Soul be zealouſly and earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon what we are about: for God ſees not as Man ſees; he regards not ſo much the outward Geſtures of our Body, though (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) he expects theſe from us too; but he looks eſpecially upon the inward Thoughts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of our Heart; and if theſe be not right all our bodily worſhip is nothing worth. If we draw near to God with our Lips, and our Heart be far from him; if we lift up our Eyes and our Hands to Heaven, and our Mind be wedded to the World; if we proſtrate our Bodies upon the Earth and lay our Mouths in the Duſt, yet if our Spirit be not proportionably humbled, all this is no better than groſs Hypocriſie, a downright mocking of God who cannot be deceived with counterfeit ſhews and ſhadows of Religion. If therefore we deſire to glorifie God aright, we muſt be ſure chiefly and principally to glorifie him in our Spirit, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes us, we muſt <hi>keep our Heart with all diligence; for out of it are the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of life,</hi> Prov. 4.23. Now this glorifying God in our Spirit implies briefly thus much; That we make a free-will-offering of our Soul unto God, <hi>committing the keeping of it unto him as unto a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator,</hi> permitting him to guide and govern it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107594:39"/>according to his own good will and pleaſure throughout the whole courſe of our life, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever circumſtances, both in Proſperity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; ſo that every thought and motion of it may evermore tend to his Glory. He that hath made ſuch an Offering as this unto God will always remember that he is not his own, but that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul are bought with a price, and that both of them are God's; and conſequently will be careful to direct all his Thoughts, Words and Actions to this one end, that the Glory of God may be advanced by whatſoever he undertakes. He will have God always in his thoughts, as the only Object of his higheſt Love and Adoration: and this will make him watch continually over his Soul, and keep it pure and undefiled, that no unclean thing may enter into that Spirit which is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the God of Purity. For certainly nothing can be a more powerful motive to induce us to keep our Heart with all diligence than the conſideration of God's Omnipreſence and Omniſcience, that he ſees us perpetually in our moſt private Retirements, and ſearches and knows our moſt ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thoughts. Hence it was that God himſelf gave that command to the Father of the Faithful, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> He that walks before God, that is, he that orders his whole Life and Converſation as knowing and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that God's Eye is always upon him, cannot chuſe but endeavour to keep both his Soul and his Body blameleſs and undefiled, and ſtrive to be <hi>perfect as his Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> Again, he that hath made ſuch an Offering as this of his Soul unto God will be careful that in all things his Soul be obedient and conformable to the Will of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107594:39"/>God. In his Health and Proſperity, if Riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe he will not ſet his Heart upon them; but with Humility and Thankfulneſs will receive them as knowing himſelf not to be a Proprietor, but a Steward only of the manifold Bleſſings of God, and will accordingly diſpoſe of them ſo that God may have the Glory, and his diſtreſſed Brethren the benefit of his Wealth. On the other hand, if God ſends Trouble and Affliction unto him, if he deprives him of his Eſtate, or his Health, or both together, whatſoever Calamity befalls him, he will ſtill bleſs and praiſe his Name as well when he takes away as when he gives, when he ſmites as well as when he heals; knowing and conſidering that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he either enjoys or ſuffers in this World comes to him from the Hand of an infinitely wiſe, and good, and gracious Father that will be ſure firſt or laſt to make all things work together for good to them that love him: Thus will the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Will and Pleaſure of God be unto him as it were the Load-ſtar to guide and direct his Soul how to ſteer its courſe towards the Haven of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs ſtreight and ſteddy through all the Changes and Chances of this mortal life, teaching him that hard Leſſon, which ſo few can learn, how to ſeparate Riches from Pride, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty from Impatience; that neither the one may prevail with him to forget God and worſhip Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, nor the other to repine at the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to fret and vex himſelf at the Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Brethren. If God bleſſes him he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf to be leſs than the leaſt of all his Mercies; and if he afflicts him, he will receive it as the Correction of a tender Father that pities and loves his Children, even when he chaſtizes them.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107594:40"/>Laſtly, He that hath made this Offering of his Soul unto God whenſoever he is in God's Houſe in order to the celebration of his Publick Worſhip, or whenſoever he is in his Cloſet performing his Private Devotions, will be exceeding careful to ſet his Heart and Affections then eſpecially upon thoſe things which are above; he will be ſure to baniſh all worldly thoughts out of his Mind, and ſtudy to behave himſelf ſo as becomes one that is admitted to appear in the Preſence-Chamber of the King of Kings, either to put up his Petitions to him, or to receive his Commands; following that excellent Counſel of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 5.1. <hi>Keep thy Foot when thou goeſt to the Houſe of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the Sacrifice of Fools: for they conſider not that they do evil.</hi> And how few there are that do follow this Counſel is but too evident from that vain and looſe Deportment of many perſons which we daily ſee in the Church, to the great ſcandal and grief of all pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians, who cannot chuſe but be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly troubled and offended to ſee God publickly diſhonoured and affronted in his own Houſe, by perſons that pretend to come thither on purpoſe to joyn in the Celebration of his Publick Worſhip and Praiſe. But of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more anon, when I come to ſhew you how we are to glorifie God in our Body, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to do.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> as before I obſerved, That we are to glorifie God in our Spirit, by keeping it pure and undefiled by ſin; ſo muſt we do in our Body too, For it is impoſſible that a clean Soul ſhould dwell in an unclean Body: but if the one be foul the other will certainly partake of its Pollutions. Indeed it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107594:40"/>is impoſſible that the Body ſhould ſin without the Soul, ſince it cannot act but by the Command and Concurrent Aſſiſtance of the Soul, whereas the Soul may ſin without the help of the Body, and we may commit Adultery, or Murder, or Theft in our Heart though our Body never be concerned in the perpetration of any ſuch Crimes. And therefore whoſoever truly and ſincerely glorifies God in his Spirit will by a moſt inevitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence glorifie him in his Body alſo. He that hath baniſhed all unchaſt thoughts out of his Mind will make a Covenant with his Eyes too, that they ſhall not caſt a wanton glance upon Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He whoſe Heart is free from all covetous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after his Neighbour's Goods will keep his Hands alſo from picking and ſtealing. He that is perfectly in Charity with all Men, and is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ready to forgive, but heartily loves, his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will not only fetter his Feet that they ſhall not be ſwift to ſhed Blood, but he will alſo bridle his Tongue, and keep it from evil-ſpeaking, lying and ſlandering, and will be ſo far from hurting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man by word or deed, that he will moſt gladly embrace every opportunity that is offered him of doing good to any that ſtand in need of help. He therefore that hath devoted his Soul wholly to the Glory of God, will devote his Body likewiſe to the ſame end; he will be careful to cleanſe his Hands as well as his Heart, to purifie his whole Man; and ſince God hath bought his Body as well as his Soul with a price, ſince one as well as the other is a Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and a Member of Chriſt, he will endeavour to the beſt of his power that both of them may be preſerved blameleſs, and undefiled, and unſpotted of the World, knowing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107594:41"/>that God will in no wiſe accept of a polluted Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. And this is the direct ſenſe and meaning of the Apoſtle's Argument from the fifteenth Verſe to the end of this Chapter, whereby he labours to diſſwade the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from Fornication, and all manner of Uncleanneſs. <hi>Flee Fornication,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>every ſin that a Man doth is without the Body; but he that committeth Fornication ſinneth againſt his own Body. What, know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your Body and in your Spirit, which are God's.</hi> But further, if we will glorifie God in our Body as we ought, we muſt not only be careful to keep it chaſt and undefiled by Luſt and Wantonneſs, but we muſt ſtudy to adorn and beautify it, ſo that it may be acceptable in the ſight of God, by Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Sobriety, and Moderation in all things, endeavouring to preſerve it free from all manner of Luxury and Exceſs whether in Meat, or Drink, or Apparel, or Recreation, or whatſoever elſe with which it is concerned. Meat and Drink in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life are ſo neceſſary to us that we cannot live without them; but if we indulge our ſelves in the immoderate uſe of either of them, inſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving our Health it will moſt certainly deſtroy it. So likewiſe modeſt and decent Raiment is in a manner as neceſſary, for the covering our Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and defending us from the Injuries of the Weather; but ſtill at the beſt it is but the Devil's Livery, which we had never worn had it not been for the Diſobedience of our firſt Parents, and which it much better becomes us to be aſhamed of than to glory in. If therefore we affect vain and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107594:41"/>pompous Attire, if we long for every fantaſtick Dreſs as faſt as the apiſh Faſhion-mongers can invent them, till we have array'd our ſelves ſo that we think we may vie both for Smell and Beauty with the Lilies of the Field; by ſo doing, though we may hide the Nakedneſs of our Body, we ſhall moſt certainly diſcover that of our Soul; and we ſhall appear loathſome and deformed, not only in the Eyes of God, from whom nothing can be hid, but in the Eyes alſo of all godly and ſober Chriſtians, and ſhall ſtink in their Noſtrils amidſt all our precious Odours and Perfumes. And therefore our Bleſſed Saviour hath commanded us not to take any care for the Proviſion either of Meat, or Drink, or Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, any further than what Neceſſity and Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy requires, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.31. <hi>Take no thought, ſaying, What ſhall we eat? or, what ſhall we drink? or, wherewithall ſhall we be cloathed? (for after all theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek) for your Heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all theſe things. But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Such care as this much better becomes an Epicure that expects his Portion in this life, than a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that owns himſelf to be but a Stranger and a Sojourner here upon Earth, and whoſe Treaſure, and Heart, and Converſation is in Heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as our Apoſtle exhorts us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether we eat, or drink, or whatſoever we do, let us do all to the Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, we are to glorifie God in our Body, by labouring daily in ſome honeſt Calling; that ſo we may provide for our ſelves and our Families, and be uſeful and ſerviceable to our Country. It was a Command as well as a Curſe that God laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107594:42"/>all Mankind in the perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Tranſgreſſion; <hi>In the ſweat of thy Face ſhalt thou eat Bread.</hi> And if we yield a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Obedience to this Command, labouring as God hath ordained in a lawful Employment, we may turn this Curſe into a Bleſſing, and provide for our ſelves not only <hi>that Meat which periſhes</hi> in this World, but that <hi>which endures unto everlaſting life</hi> in the next. And on the other hand, whoſoever thinks to exempt himſelf from the force of this Command, until ſome natural, or accidental Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity hath diſpenſed with him, ſhall not eſcape the Sentence of the Curſe; but if he will not ſweat here, he ſhall be ſure to burn hereafter: he ſhall have no Bread in this World (or at leaſt, none that he can juſtly call his own) and he ſhall want Water in the other wherewithal to cool his Tongue. Not that all Men are obliged by this Command to the ſame meaſure and Degree of bodily Labour (this were to degrade the States-man from the Council-table to the Threſhing-floor, and the King himſelf from ſitting upon his Throne to grind at the Mill) but that all Men are obliged in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stations and Capacities to employ their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as well as their Soul to the Glory of God, and to the Service of the Country wherein they live. And this may be done by him that manages but a Pen as well as by him that holds a Plough; and, if he orders his buſineſs well, of the two the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer undoubtedly doth not only do the greateſt ſervice both to God and Man, but takes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pains alſo, and doth moſt hurt and prejudice to his Health: for the wiſe Man hath told us, <hi>That of making many Books there is no end, and much ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is a wearineſs of the Fleſh,</hi> Eccl. 12.12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107594:42"/>as our Apoſtle exhorts us again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Let every Man wherein he is called therein abide with God.</hi> But further,</p>
               <p>We muſt glorifie God in our Body not only by our Sweat, but, if we be called to it, by our Blood too, which we muſt be always ready patiently and chearfully to ſhed for his ſake, whenſoever he is pleaſed to require it of us. The Croſs of Chriſt is a Burden that every Chriſtian is obliged to bear, and none ought to think it grievous, though many now-a-days are aſhamed of the very ſign of it. And Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, tho' it be a thing at which Fleſh and Blood is apt to ſtartle, yet it is no more than what every Diſciple of Chriſt muſt expect to have his ſhare of. Our Saviour himſelf hath told us as much, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. And whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and come after me, cannot be my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer Perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12. This indeed is the hardeſt Task that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to perform: but as it is the hardeſt ſo it is the nobleſt, that which of all things tends moſt to the Glory of God, and to our own Happineſs; and therefore we ſhould be ſo far from fearing it, that above all things we ſhould moſt earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, and as our Saviour commands us, and as we read, that the Apoſtles, and Primitive Chriſtians did, we ſhould <hi>rejoyce and be exceeding glad</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God calls us to ſuffer Perſecution, knowing that <hi>great is our reward in Heaven,</hi> and that <hi>our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107594:43"/>
               <p>Laſtly, (for I do but name theſe Particulars, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to inſiſt ſomething more largely upon that which I am now propounding) We muſt glorifie God in our Body by an humble, reverent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent behaviour of our Body in the Houſe of God, eſpecially in the time of the Celebration of his Publick Worſhip. This is a thing ſo undeniable, that one would think it ſhould be very needleſs to produce any Arguments to enforce the practice of it: and ſurely that Man muſt either have loſt the uſe of his Reaſon, or at leaſt muſt have extreamly impaired it by Prejudice and a bad Education that will not readily acknowledge, that God is to be glorified and worſhipped by us as well with our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as with our Soul. But yet if we conſider the prophane and graceleſs deportment of many (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the vulgar ſort of People) in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Churches now-a-days, that are ſo far from worſhipping God with a bended Knee, that they will not vouchſafe ſo much as to uncover their Heads before him; but moſt irreverently and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently ſit themſelves down upon their Seats and put on their Hats even in the very Face of the Lord of Hoſts; as if they came into his Houſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defie him than to adore him, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the World, that Duſt and Aſhes dares pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſit unconcerned in the preſence of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty before whoſe Throne Angels and Archangels and all the glorious Inhabitants of Heaven caſt their Crowns and fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it cannot but be granted, that it is both ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and needful to prove the neceſſity of Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Worſhip in the Houſe of God, and to exhort all Men to the practice of it; which I ſhall do (as briefly as I can) from theſe following Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:107594:43"/>
               <p>And firſt, that we muſt worſhip God with our Body as well as with our Soul is evident from this one Conſideration, becauſe God hath redeemed our Body as well as our Soul from Hell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to glorifie the one as well as the other in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is the Apoſtle's Argument in my Text, and is abundantly ſufficient of it ſelf, though there were no more to back it. <hi>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your Body and in your Spirit, which are God's.</hi> What hath God redeemed our Bodies as well as our Souls from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Miſery? and hath he promiſed to raiſe our vile Body out of the Duſt, and to change it into a Glorious, Immortal and Incorruptible Body, and to admit it together with our Soul into the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eternal Joy and Happineſs, and ſhall this Body, as if it were utterly inſenſible of this ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Favour, ſhew no demonſtrations of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to ſo great a Benefactour? What can be more ungrateful? What can be more unreaſonable?</p>
               <p>Secondly, That God requires that we ſhould worſhip him with our Body as well as with our Soul is plain from the Second Commandment, wherein he hath forbidden us to bow down our Body before an Image for this very reaſon, becauſe he is a Jealous God <hi>(i. e.)</hi> jealous of his Honour, which he declares that we rob him of whenſoever we bow our Body (thereby intending Religious Worſhip) to any other but himſelf alone. And therefore we find in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that when St. <hi>John</hi> offers to fall down and worſhip before the Feet of the Angel, the Angel forbids him; <hi>See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow Servant, and of thy Brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the Sayings of this Book, worſhip God,</hi> Rev. 22.9. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107594:44"/>neglects to pay Religious Worſhip unto God with his Body tranſgreſſes the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as he that pays that worſhip to any other thing, or perſon, but God only. Hence is that pathetical Exhortation of the <hi>Pſalmiſt; O come let us worſhip, and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker;</hi> which our Church hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed daily to be repeated by us in her Morning Service, that ſo we might be continually put in mind of this duty; and be careful always to behave our ſelves Humbly, Reverently, and Devoutly in the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, It is neceſſary that we worſhip God with our Body for the ſatisfaction both of Men and Angels. It is the peculiar Prerogative of God that he only can diſcern the ſecret Thoughts and Intentions of our Hearts; and therefore though a private Ejaculation of our Soul, wherein our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not at all concerned, may be very acceptable and well-pleaſing in his ſight at other times; yet in the time of our Publick Devotions in the Church the caſe is otherwiſe. For there both Men and Angels are Spectators of our Piety, neither of which can judge of the Sincerity of it any otherwiſe than by our outward Behaviour; which if it be devout and reverent they will conclude, that our Soul is ſo too, and will gladly joyn with us in our publick Worſhip of that God who is the common Lord and Maſter of us all. But if otherwiſe, not only all good Men will take offence at our Prophaneneſs, but we ſhall much more offend thoſe bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and provoke them to loath and abhorr our Religious Aſſemblies, which delight to frequent them ſo long as they obſerve that we behave our ſelves ſo that they may plainly diſcern our inward
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107594:44"/>Piety by our outward Deportment. And for this reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids Men to be covered in the Church, and Women to be uncovered <hi>becauſe of the Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. The Angels cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to behold any ſuch indecency and diſorder in the Church; but are highly diſpleaſed at it as a thing that tends much to the diſhonour of God, and moſt evidently diſcovers, that ſuch perſons as are guilty of it are deſtitute of true Religion; for it cannot be imagined, that when every little Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Mind cauſes (more or leſs) ſome viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alteration in our Body, that Religion, which is the nobleſt Paſſion with which our Soul can be affected (and that too at that very time when we come with a pretence to profeſs it openly before Men and Angels in God's own Houſe) ſhould cauſe no alteration at all, but that our Body all this while ſhould ſit as unconcerned as one of the Pillars of the Church. No certainly, if our Soul were truly humbled, as it ought to be before the Throne of Grace, it would command the Body to humble it ſelf likewiſe, to uncover the Head, and bend the Knee, to lift up the Eyes and the Hands, and to bear it company, with a devout and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent behaviour of all its Members, in its Suit and Supplication to the Divine Majeſty. Therefore as St. <hi>James</hi> exhorts us, to <hi>ſhew our Faith by our Works,</hi> ſo likewiſe let us ſhew the Devotion of our Soul by that of our Body. For as <hi>Faith without Works is dead,</hi> ſo is inward Piety (eſpecially in the time of God's Publick Service in the Church) dead alſo, except it be accompanied by bodily Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That God is to be worſhipped with our Body as well as with our Soul is evident from the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107594:45"/>univerſal conſent and practice of Mankind in all Ages, all Nations, and Countries of the World whatſoever. Not only Chriſtians, but Jews, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, Heathens and Pagans, all agree in this point, that Divine Worſhip is to be performed by our Body as well as by our Soul. And therefore thoſe Men that imagin Bodily Worſhip to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the Service of God and behave themſelves accordingly, do in effect render themſelves no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Monſters, not only to be wondered at, but even to be abhorred in that particular by all the reſt of Mankind; and certainly an honeſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan (being before acquainted with the Cuſtom of our Country, which obliges us to uncover our Heads, and to ſtand bare in the preſence of our betters, though but mortal Men like our ſelves) ſhould he come into ſome of our Churches, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Men ſitting irreverently with their Hats on in the Houſe of God, even at the very time when they are receiving a Meſſage concerning their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation from the Mouth of his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, would ſtand aſtoniſhed, and exclaim againſt Chriſtianity, as the moſt impious and profane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World, that allowed men to be hail fellow well met with that God whom they pretend to worſhip, ſhewing him leſs reſpect and reverence even in his own Houſe than they ordinarily pay to a Man that is but a little their Superiour either in Eſtate or Quality. And I would fain have thoſe perſons that dare be thus impudent in the preſence of the Almighty, anſwer me this one Queſtion, Whether they would do the ſame thing in caſe they ſhould ſee God viſibly ſitting upon his Throne of Glory, or in caſe they ſhould ſee the Lord Jeſus coming in the Clouds of Heaven attended with all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107594:45"/>his Angels. If in this caſe they would fall down and worſhip (as I queſtion not but that they would) I know no reaſon why they ſhould not likewiſe behave themſelves with a profound Reverence and Devotion both of Body and Soul in the Church, which is the place of God's ſpecial and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preſence, and is (when we behave our ſelves in it as we ought) a lively emblem and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven it ſelf: and then ſurely it is but reaſonable that we that ſit at God's Foot-ſtool here on Earth ſhould uncover our Heads and bend our Knees in his preſence when we read that the Holy Angels do no leſs above, caſting their Crowns and falling down and worſhipping before his Throne in Heaven: and if we will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Example now, it is greatly to be feared that we ſhall never be admitted to bear them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hereafter.</p>
               <p>But after all this, granting (which I hope I have ſufficiently proved) that bodily Worſhip of God is neceſſary, it may reaſonably be demanded wherein this bodily worſhip chiefly conſiſts, and what Geſtures and Ceremonies are to be uſed by us in our performance of it. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that herein we are to be determined by the Cuſtom of the Countrey wherein we live, and the appointment of the Church whereof we are Members. In general therefore thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and Ceremonies which by the Cuſtom of our Countrey we are obliged to uſe in token of civil Honour and Reſpect in our Addreſſes to men that are much our Superiours; as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the King himſelf; we are to uſe likewiſe by way of religious Worſhip to Almighty God. If therefore it be an affront to the King for a Subject
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107594:46"/>to be covered in his preſence, or to offer a petition ro him in any other poſture but upon his Knees; reaſon will tell us that it muſt needs be a much greater affront to God for any man to put his Hat on in his houſe, or to ſit irreverently upon his Seat when the Miniſter is upon his Knees offering up Prayers and Supplications unto the Throne of Grace in the Name of the whole Congregation. Perſons that thus miſ-behave themſelves in the Worſhip of God may juſtly expect ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him as he gives to the Prieſts that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered polluted bread upon his Altar, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Offer it now unto thy Governour, will he be pleaſed with thee or accept thy Perſon, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> In the Oriental Countries therefore where men never uſe this Ceremony of uncovering their Heads to their Superiours, but ſtand covered even in the Preſence of their Emperour; neither is it pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable in their Temples; ſince amongſt them the uncovering of the Head is ſo far from being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a Demonſtration of Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that it is indeed lookt upon to be an abſurd and ridiculous thing, and therefore inſtead thereof they uſe to put their Shooes off their feet when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they enter'd into their Churches; which is a Cuſtom in thoſe parts of greater Antiquity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf; it being not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that that command which God gave to him in the Buſh (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5.) was no inſtitution of a new Ceremony, but only an information that that place was hallowed by the extraordinary Preſence of God; and therefore he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf with the ſame fear and reverence, and to uſe the ſame manner of Worſhip and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which in thoſe Countries was uſual and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107594:46"/>cuſtomary in the Temples and holy Places dedicated to the Service of God. <hi>Put off thy ſhooes, ſaith he, from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground.</hi> And had the Ceremony of uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head been in uſe in thoſe Countries as it is here, we may rationally conjecture that God would have altered his Command accordingly. But to leave theſe remote Countries, with which we are not much concerned, and to return to our own: from what hath been ſaid it is plain that the outward Geſtures and Ceremonies which we are obliged to uſe in the publick Worſhip of God are chiefly theſe three; kneeling at Prayers, Standing up at other times when it is appointed by the Church, and having our Heads uncovered at all times. As for ſitting, though the general practice of all men hath made it to be connived at in the time of the Sermon (or the like) yet it is a poſture that is never very commendable in the Church: it is certainly in the time of Prayer moſt intolerable: and he that uſes it leaſt at other times deſerves moſt commendation, and comes neareſt to the practice of the firſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity. It was therefore a pious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhip <hi>Hall</hi> to this purpoſe in one of his Meditations. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the Lord of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alſo: and therefore challenges as well reverent Geſture as inward Devotion. I will ever in my Prayers either ſtand, as a ſervant before my Maſter; or kneel, as a Subject to my Prince.</hi> I might inſtance in more particulars, but, that I may haſten to a concluſion I ſhall name only this one, which will comprehend all the reſt; and that is, That our Bodily Worſhip may be compleat, we muſt take care that our Tongue be duly employed in bearing,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107594:47"/>its part in the publick Service of God as the Church hath appointed: which if we would do, we ſhould avoid that ſcandalous Behaviour which is too commonly ſeen in our Churches, of whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and laughing, and playing idle Tricks; which is a thing to be abominated by all pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians. Thus I have ſhewed you according to my ability the Summ and Subſtance of this duty of glorifying God in our Body, and in our Spirit; which that we may evermore perform effectually: <hi>God of his infinite mercy vouchſafe to direct, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, amd govern both our hearts and Bodies in the ways of his Laws, and in the Works of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments that through his moſt mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be preſerved in Body and Soul, through our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THERE are four ſeveral Steps or Degrees of our Saviour's Exaltation: Three of which are already paſt, and the other is yet to come. The firſt is his Reſurrection from the Dead: The ſecond is his Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The third is his Seſſion at the Right Hand of God: The fourth is his coming again with Glory to judge both the Quick and the Dead. The firſt of theſe, his Reſurrection from the Dead we Commemorated at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and the preſent time invites us now to Exerciſe our Meditations upon the ſecond, his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and any Text furniſhes us with a very excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the doing of it to the Glory of God, and the Good and Comfort of our own Souls. For firſt, the Apoſtle lays down the Truth of this Doctrine, that our Saviour is aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107594:48"/>and ſecondly, he ſhews us what influence the conſideration of his Aſcenſion ſhould have upon us. So that the Text it ſelf is an Epitome of a Sermon containing both Doctrine and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Doctrine that our Saviour is aſcended into Heaven, the Apoſtle takes for granted in the former part of the Verſe, <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High-prieſt, that is paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus the Son of God.</hi> And this Doctrine he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy Places made with Hands, which are the Figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Such an High-prieſt became us, who is Holy, Harmleſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled, ſeparate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens.</hi> The Application which the Apoſtle makes of this Doctrine is in the latter part of my Text, and it is this, that ſince Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven, we ought ſtoutly and reſolutely to maintain the Profeſſion of our Chriſtian Religion, and to contend earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints. <hi>Seeing then,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In ſpeaking to which Text, I ſhall do theſe three Things; Firſt, I ſhall ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer, the Eternal Son of God, is truly aſcended into Heaven. Secondly, That he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thither as our High-prieſt. And Thirdly, I ſhall conclude with the Apoſtles Application, and ſhew you how ſtrongly this ſhould oblige us to hold faſt our Profeſſion. Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you, That Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer, the Eternal Son of God, he who we own and believe to be the true Meſſias, whom all the Prophets pointed at, is truly aſcended into Heaven. And here it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107594:48"/>to clear two Things by the way. Firſt, What is meant by that Heaven into which Chriſt is aſcended; And ſecondly, how, and in what manner he is ſaid to have aſcended thither. For the firſt of theſe, not to trouble you with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the ſeveral Significations of the word Heaven in Scripture, we are to underſtand by that Heaven into which our Saviour is aſcended, the Heaven of Heavens, the higheſt and moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heaven, which is the Imperial Throne of the Majeſty of God, far above all thoſe Celeſtial Orbs which are viſible to our Sight, wherein the Sun, and Moon, and Stars perform their conſtant and regular Motions, according to thoſe Laws which God gave them at their firſt Creation. Through all theſe Heavens our Saviour paſſed in his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as is plain from my Text, if we conſult the Original (for what our Tranſlation Renders <hi>is paſſed into the Heavens,</hi> is in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is paſſed through the Heavens, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> through all theſe viſible Heavens, into that inviſible one, wherein he dwelt with his Father in inacceſſible Light and Glory, and Majeſty from all Eternity. And that this is the meaning of that Heaven into which our Saviour is aſcended, is plain from that Expreſſion of our Apoſtle, which I cited before, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.26. where he tells us, That ſuch an High-prieſt became us, as was <hi>made higher than the Heavens:</hi> And likewiſe from that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. <hi>He that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above all Heavens.</hi> Thus ye ſee what is meant by that Heaven, into which our Saviour is aſcended. For the ſecond Thing, how, and in what manner he is ſaid to have aſcended thither: I anſwer, he aſcended not by any local
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107594:49"/>Motion or Tranſlation of his Divine Nature from Earth to Heaven, (for that being Infinite and Omnipreſent, filling all places at once, cannot be ſuppoſed to be capable of being removed any whither, where before it was not) but he aſcended by tranſlating his humane Nature, his whole Man, both Body and Soul, from Earth, where he had aſſumed that Nature, and hypoſtatically united it to his Divinity, unto the Right Hand of God in the higheſt Heavens. And that Chriſt is thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven, the Scripture moſt amply and plainly aſſures us. Firſt, this Aſcenſion of his was typified and prefigured under the Moſaical Law, by the High-prieſts entering once a Year in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy of Holies, to make an Atonement for himſelf, and the People, as our Apoſtle ſhews us, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. of this Epiſtle. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt, this ſignifying,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That the way into the holieſt of all was not made manifeſt, while as the firſt Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was yet ſtanding, which was a Figure for the time then preſent. But Chriſt being come an High-prieſt of good Things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with Hands, that is to ſay, not of this Building, neither by the Blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own Blood, entered in once into the Holy Place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us.</hi> Again, this Aſcenſion of our Saviour into Heaven, was Typified by thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Tranſlations of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was foretold by the Prophets, as appears by that of <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led Captivity Captive. Thou haſt received Gifts for Men;</hi> which place St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly applies to our Saviour's Aſcenſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 24. is almoſt all of it a prophetical Deſcription of this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107594:49"/>Aſcenſion, and is therefore very fitly appointed by our Church, to be Read upon that Day, which we ſet apart for the Commemoration of it. To the ſame effect, is that Prophecy of <hi>Iſai. chap.</hi> 63.1. where the Prophet deſcribes the Holy Hoſt of Heaven rejoicing and wondering at the Glorious Aſcenſion of our Lord into thoſe everlaſting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. <hi>Who is this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that cometh from</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>with died Garments from</hi> Bozrah? <hi>This that is Glorious in his Apparel, travelling in the greatneſs of his Strength? I that ſpeak in Righteouſneſs, mighty to Save.</hi> And as our Saviour's Aſcenſion was typified and foretold in the Old Teſtament, ſo we find that all thoſe Types and Prophecies were made good, and fulfilled in the New. There we have a moſt faithful and punctual Account, as of his Nativity, his Paſſion, his Reſurrection from the Dead, ſo likewiſe of his Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This we find that our Saviour himſelf plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretold ſome Days before it came to paſs; <hi>Go to my Brethren,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Mary Magdalen, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to my God and your God,</hi> Joh. 20.17. And when this was to be fulfilled, that there might not want ſufficient Witneſſes to atteſt the truth of his Aſcenſion, the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, That when he was about to aſcend up to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he led his Diſciples out as far as to <hi>Bethany;</hi> and that there he lift up his Hands and Bleſſed them; and that while he Bleſſed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into Heaven. But ſtill further, leſt any ſhould doubt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our Saviour's being viſibly parted from his Diſciples, and received up into the Air, whether he did really aſcend into Heaven or not, to remove
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107594:50"/>all manner of occaſion of ſuch doubting God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſends two Angels from Heaven to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them that he was really aſcended thither: for the ſtory tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10. <hi>That while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward Heaven as he went up, behold two men ſtood by them in white Apparel; which alſo ſaid, Ye men of</hi> Galilee, <hi>why ſtand ye gazing up into Heaven? This ſame Jeſus, which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into Heaven.</hi> Now there remains no ground at all of doubting whether our Saviour be really aſcended into Heaven, or no, ſince what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's eyes were not able viſible to behold, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of two Angels hath undeniably confirmed. Thus much briefly of my firſt particular, that Chriſt our Redeemer is truly and really aſcended into Heaven, <hi>i.e.</hi> that his humane Nature, both Body and Soul, are actually by the Omnipotent Power of his God-head tranſlated into the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, that he is aſcended into Heaven as our High-prieſt. It is true, that Chriſt aſcended into Heaven for his own ſake as well as for ours. For ſurely, he that for the expiation of God's Wrath had humbled himſelf ſo low, he that had wrought ſo glorious a Work as the Redemption of Mankind, and that by undergoing moſt bitter and unconceivable Sufferings did highly deſerve to be exalted to the Right-hand of his Heavenly Father. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he himſelf ſaith that theſe ſufferings of his were the way to his glory. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> Luke 24.26. But although Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven for himſelf, that he might
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107594:50"/>take poſſeſſion of that Kingdom which he had juſtly deſerved; yet he aſcended thither for us alſo: As at his Reſurection he aroſe from the dead not for himſelf only, but for us alſo, and became <hi>the Firſt-fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> ſo likewiſe at his Aſcenſion he paſſed into the Heavens; as our High-prieſt, by virtue of whoſe Aſcenſion all his Elect ſhall aſcend up after him unto the ſame place of Glory and Immortality. This is evident from theſe words of my Text, <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High prieſt, that is paſsed into the Heavens, Jeſus the Son of God. This the Scripture teſtifies frequently in other places. We have ſuch an High-prieſt,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>who is ſet on the Right-hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens; a Miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle which the Lord pitched and not Man,</hi> Heb. 81.2. <hi>and</hi> c. 6.20. he tells us that <hi>the Fore-runner is for us entred into that within the Veil, even Jeſus, made an High-prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi> Now the office of Chriſt our High-prieſt conſiſts chiefly in theſe things. 1. In being our Advocate to make interceſſion for us to the Father. <hi>If any man ſin,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John, we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. and <hi>who is he that condemneth?</hi> ſaith S. Paul. <hi>It is Chriſt that died; yearather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us.</hi> Rom. 8.34. How great a favour how ineſtimable a benfiet is this to have the only beloved Son of God in whom he is well pleaſed, and to whom he will deny, nothing continually to plead and make interceſſion for us unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! They only are truly ſenſible of this Bleſſing who are wounded with the Arrows of the Almighty,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107594:51"/>and preſſed ſore with his hand, ſo that there is no ſoundneſs in their fleſh, becauſe of his anger, neither any reſt in their Bones becauſe of their Sin, They find the benefit of ſuch an Interceſſion, and how deſperate and remedileſs their condition would be, had they not ſuch an High-prieſt that is ever ready upon their true Repentance to make an atonement for them, to plead the merit of his ſufferings in their behalf, and to interpoſe betwixt them and the wrath of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt aſcended into Heaven as our High-prieſt, that being thither aſcended he might ſend unto us the Comforter, even the Holy Ghoſt to abide with us for ever. This was one main reaſon of his Aſcenſion, as himſelf declares to his Diſciples. <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi> This he had promiſed long before by the prophet <hi>Joel</hi> c. 2. of that Prophecy, v. 28. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall propheſie, your old men ſhall dream Dreams, your young men ſhall ſee Viſions.</hi> This promiſe he fulfilled upon his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles upon the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and he performs it dayly to all his elect continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and increaſing in their hearts the Graces of his Holy Spirit by the Miniſtery of his word. This is that bleſſed Spirit of truth that guides us into all truth and teaches us all things, that bears witneſs with our Spirits that we are the children of God, and ſeals us unto the day of Redemption; and this Holy Spirit Chriſt as our High-prieſt ſends unto us from Heaven. For although he be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107594:51"/>preſent every where, in reſpect of his Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which is Omnipreſent; yet by his gracious Operation, he is preſent only in the Hearts of his Elect, unto whom he is ſent by Chriſt as a Pledge of his Love, to abide with them <hi>for ever. The third Office which Chriſt performs for us, as our High-prieſt is,</hi> to prepare a place for us in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> had ſhut the Gate of Heaven againſt us: For nothing that is Defiled or Unclean ſhall enter into the New <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but Chriſt by his perfect Obedience, and by his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sufferings for our Sakes, hath Expiated the Guilt of this Sin; and by his aſcending up thither himſelf, hath opened unto us the Gate of Heaven again, and given us aſſurance that he will draw us up after him. This he promiſed to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. <hi>I go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf; that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> Thus is Chriſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven as our High-prieſt, he is gone thither before us to prepare a place for us; a place of endleſs Bliſs and Felicity in thoſe glorious Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Heavenly Father. And ſo I have done with the Doctrinal part of my Text, and ſhewed you that Chriſt is really aſcended into Heaven, and that he is aſcended thither as our High-prieſt.</p>
               <p>I come now to the laſt Thing I propounded, which is, to preſs to you the Apoſtles Application; and to ſhew you how ſtrongly the Conſideration of this Doctrine ſhould oblige us to hold faſt our Profeſſion. And what can oblige us more to hold faſt our Profeſſion, to lead a Godly and a Chriſtian Life, and to have our Converſation in Heaven,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107594:52"/>than this; that we have a great High-prieſt, Jeſus the Son of God, that is already paſſed into the Heavens, on purpoſe to prepare for us there an Everlaſting Crown of Glory? The conſideration of the bleſſed Effects of the Aſcenſion of our Lord, if we make a right uſe of it, will enable us to fight the good fight of Faith with Courage, to keep our ſelves unſpotted of the World in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Circumſtances we are, and to ſteer our Courſe aright through all the manifold Changes and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Mortal Life, till we arrive at the end of our Hope, even the Salvation of our Souls. Let our Condition be what it will, good or bad, I ſay, the thoughts of this will enable us to behave our ſelves ſo, as ſhall be moſt for the Glory of God, and our own Good. For, firſt, Hath God Bleſſed us with Peace and Proſperity in this World? Hath he given us a plentiful Portion of the good Things of this Life? Hath he heaped upon us Riches and Honour, filled our Barns with Plenty, and cauſed <hi>our Preſſes to burſt out with new Wine?</hi> Though theſe things are ſtrong Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and very apt to alienate our Hearts from God, yet the conſideration of our Saviour's Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will enable us to overcome them. If in the midſt of theſe worldly Bleſſings, we frequently and ſeriouſly call to mind, that we have a great High-prieſt, that is preparing for us things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably better, and more glorious in Heaven; our Eyes then will not be dazled, nor our Hearts bewitched, with theſe fading and periſhing Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Earth: We ſhall ſet no higher an Eſtimate upon them than they deſerve, but ſhall be careful to uſe them with a Chriſtian Prudence and Moderation, to the glory of God, and the good
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107594:52"/>of our Selves; and ſuch poor Members of Chriſt as we ſee ſtand in need of our <hi>Charity. We ſhall</hi> look upon all theſe temporal Bleſſings to be but only lent us for a time; but our Hearts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will be wholly fixed with moſt ardent and longing Deſires upon that eternal and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inheritance which our High-prieſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us <hi>in Heaven.</hi> Thus I ſay, if in this World God hath bleſſed us with Wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the conſideration of our Saviour's Aſcenſion will be a powerful means to reſtrain us from the abuſe of thoſe Bleſſings; ſo that we ſhall neither Idolize our Wealth with the Covetous, nor with the Prodigal waſte and conſume it upon our Luſts: But ſhall wiſely improve it to our beſt advantage, ſo as to make to our ſelves friends of the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Unrighteouſneſs. Secondly, On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hath God dealt otherwiſe with us? Hath he with-held theſe Bleſſings from us? Is our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this World very Poor and Mean, ſo that we have not where-withal to help our ſelves, but are fain to be beholding both for Food and Raiment, and whatſoever is neceſſary to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our Lives to our richer Neighbours? The conſideration of our Saviour's Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will exceedingly comfort us, and ſupport our Spirits in the midſt of our Want and Penury. For how can we be troubled at our low Fortune in this World, when we remember that we have an High-prieſt in Heaven, that hath a Crown of Glory in his Hand ready to put on our Heads, as ſoon as our Earthly Tabernacle is diſſolved? Nay, more than this, is our Condition here yet worſe? Are we not only Poor and Deſpicable, but are we moreover Perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake? Doth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107594:53"/>the World frown upon us, and rage againſt us with all its Fury? Let us not be diſcouraged for all this: And we cannot be, if we conſider, as it follows in the Verſe after my Text, that in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>we have not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities; but was in all points tempted, like as we are, yet without Sin.</hi> He himſelf, when he was here on Earth, was ſo Poor, that he had not an Houſe wherein to lay his Head. He was all his Life long a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief, and was at the laſt moſt cruelly and deſpightfully Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted even unto Death. And as he himſelf <hi>was for the ſuffering of Death, crowned with Glory and Honour,</hi> ſo hath he promiſed the ſame Reward to all thoſe that ſuffer for his ſake. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are Perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake: For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.10. <hi>How then can Perſecution ſeem grievous to us, when</hi> we conſider that we ſuffer for our High-prieſt, who hath ſuffered far greater and bitterer Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for us, than we can do for him, and who now ſits on the Right Hand of God, ready to make us a vaſt amends for our light and momentary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction here, by beſtowing upon us <hi>a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of Glory?</hi> Thus power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the Meditation of our Saviour's Aſcenſion, to guide and direct us, to make us wary and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Proſperity, and to ſtrengthen and comfort us, and to make us patient and couragious in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and to arm and fortifie us both againſt the ſmiles and frowns of the World. Nay, Secondly, When Death it ſelf approaches near us, when the King of Terrors is ready to ſeize upon us, the ſame Meditation will make us bid that Hour wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107594:53"/>when we conſider that we have an High-prieſt in Heaven, that hath ſwallowed up Death in Victory, ſo that to all true Believers it is now but aſleep, the Gate through which we muſt enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eternal Life. Again, Thirdly, Which is worſe than Death, and which is the very ſting and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Death it ſelf; are we at any time terrified and affrighted at the ſight of any grievous Sin, into which, by the Temptation of the Devil, and through our own Luſts we have fallen? Is our Soul ſmitten into the place of Dragons, and brought down as it were even to Hell with the dreadful apprehenſion of the Wrath of God, which thereby we have juſtly deſerved? Let not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (who in ſuch a Caſe, is ever ready to do it) perſwade us to Deſpair, that there is no hopes of Mercy for us, but that now God hath hid his Face from us for ever, and that he will be no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by us. But let us ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God: For I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and my God.</hi> Let us remember, that tho' we have ſinned, yet we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the Propitiation for our Sins. Let us remember, that tho' we have ſinned, yet we have a great High-prieſt, that is paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus the Son of God, who ever lives to make Interceſſion for us. Let us not therefore Deſpair, but Repent. <hi>Let us,</hi> truſting in the Merits and Righteouſneſs of our High-prieſt, <hi>come boldly,</hi> tho' humbly and penitently, <hi>to the Throne of Grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> And if we do ſo come, we may aſſure our ſelves,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107594:54"/>that we ſhall find both Grace and Mercy. Not one Tear that proceeds from godly Sorrow ſhall drop to the ground, not one penitential Sigh ſhall be breathed in vain, but our High-prieſt will be ſure to preſent all our Tears, our Sighs, our Prayers and Supplications before his Father, and never ceaſe his Interceſſion in our behalf, until our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don be Sealed in <hi>Heaven. Thus you ſee that in</hi> whatſoever Circumſtances we are engaged, the Meditation of our Saviour's Aſcenſion is ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beneficial to our Souls. And ſeeing that it is ſo, how ſhould it oblige us to hold faſt our Profeſſion? How ſhould the thoughts of this, as they are ever profitable, ſo be ever welcome and dear unto us? Let us not then ſet up our Staff on this ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> let us not lie groveling upon Earth, nor ſuffer our ſelves to be enamoured of the Things of this World, which are not worthy of our Thoughts; but let us ſeek thoſe Things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the Right Hand of God. Let us remember, that here we are but Strangers and Pilgrims, and therefore let us behave our ſelves ſo as becomes Sojourners; uſing this World ſo as if we uſed it not, knowing that our own Native Country, where we expect our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, is afar off, even in Heaven, whither our High-prieſt is paſſed before us to prepare a place for us. Oh then! if we deſire hereafter to aſcend up thither after him, that we may for ever be Happy in his Preſence, let us now hold faſt our Profeſſion: That we may be able at that great Day to meet the Lord in the Air, and to aſcend up with him into Heaven; let us now Purifie our ſelves, even as he is Pure. <hi>Let us lay aſide every Weight, and the Sin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107594:54"/>let us run with patience the Race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our Faith; who, for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame, and is ſet down at the Right Hand of the Throne of God.</hi> Let us continually lift up our Hearts with moſt devout and ardent Affections unto him, who is our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, our Prieſt, and our King; yielding as far as we are able an intire and impartial Obedience to all his Laws, ſubmitting our Selves wholly to his Will, and to the guidance of his Holy Spirit in all Things. So when this King of Glory ſhall come again with the Keys of Heaven and Hell in his Hands, to render unto every Man according to his Works, he ſhall open for us thoſe everlaſting Doors, through which he himſelf is already paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as our Fore-runner, and place us in thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Manſions of Bliſs and Joy, which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, where we ſhall be Kings and Prieſts unto God for ever. Unto which unconceivable Glory and Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>GREAT Travel is created for every Man,</hi> (ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach, Eccleſ.</hi> 40.1.) <hi>and an heavy Yoke is upon the Sons of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>from the Day that they go out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb, till the Day that they return to the Mother of all Things. Their imagination of Things to come, and the Day of Death trouble their Thoughts, and cauſe fear of Heart; from him that ſitteth on a Throne of Glory, unto him that is humbled in Earth and Aſhes; from him that weareth Purple and a Crown, unto him that is clothed with a Linen Frock.</hi> This is the ſad Condition of all the Sons of Men by Nature; an unhappy Patrimony entailed upon us by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience, and from which nothing but the perfect Righteouſneſs, and ſatisfaction of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> can deliver us. The former utterly ruined and undid us, when we were once Happy: The latter came on purpoſe to ſeek and to ſave us, when we were loſt. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hung upon our Necks, the heavy and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107594:55"/>Yoke of Satan; a Burden under which the whole Creation groans, and which, if we ſhake it not off, will at the laſt ſink us down into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit: The latter came to reſcue us from this Bondage, and to lay upon us a Yoke indeed too, but ſuch a Yoke that ſhould be ſo far from pinching and oppreſſing us, that it ſhould exalt us, and draw us up with it even to the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, a Yoke that ſhould be light and eaſie to us at the preſent, and that ſhould procure for us Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt and Felicity hereafter. And here in my Text he makes a moſt gracious Invitation, and a promiſe of Refreſhment to every Man, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf thus Burdened and Oppreſſed, will come unto him for help. <hi>Come unto me all ye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the handling of which Words, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe three Things. Firſt, Who they are that are here invited. Secondly, Unto whom they are invited. Thirdly, For what end they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited. Firſt, Then they to whom this Invitation is made, are they <hi>that Labour, and are heavy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> and that not ſome few of them only, but all without any exception; all ſuch are welcome Gueſts unto Chriſt. <hi>Come unto me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all ye that Labour, and are heavy Laden.</hi> This Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then ſeems to be made without reſpect of Perſons, to all Mankind: For nothing is more certain, than that all Mankind is heavy laden with the burden of Sin, which is the Thing here meant in theſe Words. This is ſo evident from innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Texts of Scripture, that I need not produce Arguments to prove it: <hi>For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> But tho' no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be more plain than that all have ſinned, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107594:56"/>conſequently that all are laden with this Burden; yet nothing is more plain alſo, than that all do not Labour under it. Many Men, indeed, moſt Men, are ſo far from labouring under the Burden of Sin, that they delight and take pleaſure in it, and can by no means be perſwaded to think of parting with it. Such Perſons as theſe are ſo far from ſeeking Reſt, in being eaſed of their Sins, that on the contrary, they ſeek for Reſt and Happineſs in Sin it ſelf, where it is certain that it never can be found: For <hi>there is no Peace ſaith my God to the Wicked.</hi> Such therefore are excluded from this Invitation of our Saviour, who, tho' he calls Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto him, yet calls none but ſuch as are weary of their Sins, and deſire to be delivered from them. Secondly, Such are excluded likewiſe, who truſt in their own Righteouſneſs, and preſume that they have little or no need of a Saviour. Such were the Phariſees of Old, of whom our Lord gives us a Character, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. in the Example of the Phariſee that juſtified himſelf, and deſpiſed the Publican, praying on this manner, <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Unjuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican. I faſt twice in the Week; I give Tithes of all that I Poſſeſs.</hi> And ſuch are thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this Day, who preſume that they can merit Heaven by their own Works; nay, more than ſo, that they can do Works of Supererrogation, and ſell them alſo for the benefit of others that ſtand in need of them, contrary to the expreſs Command of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. <hi>When ye have done all thoſe Things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſay, We are unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107594:56"/>to the Example of the wiſe Virgins, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.9. who refuſed to part with any of their Oyl unto the Fooliſh; <hi>leſt there be not enough,</hi> ſay they, <hi>for us and you: But go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for your ſelves.</hi> Such Perſons as theſe then, both ſuch as delight in Sin, and ſuch as truſt in their own Righteouſneſs, are utterly excluded from this Invitation of our Saviour: There is no Promiſe, no hopes of Reſt for any ſuch. But all they that would be welcome Gueſts unto Chriſt, muſt be ſenſible of the heavy Load and Burden of their Sins, ſo as to be heartily weary of it, and moſt earneſtly to deſire to be rid of it. So that here is a double Qualification required in all thoſe Perſons, whom Chriſt here ſo graciouſly calls unto him. Firſt, They muſt feel the Burden of their Sins, ſo as to Labour under it, to be extremely wearied and oppreſſed with it. Secondly, They muſt unfeignedly deſire to be rid of this Burthen, ſo as to be delivered not only from the Puniſhment that is due unto Sin; but from the Guilt alſo and Pollution of Sin, that it may no longer reign <hi>in their mortal Body, that they ſhould obey it in the Luſts thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, all that will come unto Chriſt, muſt feel the burthen of their Sins, ſo as to labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and to be extremly wearied and oppreſſed with it. This is evident from the expreſs Words of our Saviour's Invitation here in my Text, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</hi> Now that Sin is a moſt intolerable and inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Burthen, muſt needs appear to all Men that will ſeriouſly conſider it upon theſe two Accounts. 1. From the danger of it. 2. From the foulneſs and loathſomneſs of it. Firſt, That Sin is of all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107594:57"/>things the moſt dangerous is acknowledged by all men that believe that there is a God who as he is a rewarder of all them that diligently ſeek him, ſo he is a God alſo to who vengeance belongs, that will by no means clear the guilty, but will turn the wicked and all that forget him into Hell. All the Miſeries both of this life and of that which is to come are the effects and conſequence of Sin: what diſmal plagues and judgments it renders us obnoxious to in this world we read at large, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. It brings a curſe upon our ſelves and all that belongs to us in all places whitherſoever we go, in all Buſineſs whatſoever we undertake; a <hi>curſe in the city, and a curſe in the field, a curſe upon our baſket and our ſtore, upon the fruit of our Body, and the fruit of our land, the increaſe of our kine and the flocks of our ſheep.</hi> It brings upon us War, Famine, Peſtilence, <hi>a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and ſorrow of mind: ſo that our life ſhall hang in doubt before us, and we ſhall fear day and night, and ſhall have none aſſurance of our life. In the Morning we ſhall ſay, would God it were Even; and at even we ſhall ſay, would God it were Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for the fear of our heart wherewith we ſhall fear, and for the ſight of our eyes which we ſhall ſee.</hi> This, and much more than this is the danger of Sin in this life, as ye may ſee in the Chapters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned. And ſurely this, if there were no more might be enough to ſatisfie us, that Sin is a burden under which no man living is able to ſtand upright. And yet all this is but the beginning of ſorrow, is nothing in compariſon of that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which Sin will certainly bring upon all thoſe that forſake it not in the world to come. <hi>There ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:107594:57"/>Thoſe torments as they ſhall be incomparably greater than what any man can ſuffer in this life as to extremity of pain, ſo they ſhall be infinitely greater in one reſpect for they ſhall know no end; but when the reprobate Men and Angels ſhall have lien in Hell ten thouſand thouſand times as many Millions of ages as there are drops of water in the Ocean or grains of duſt in the Body of the Earth, their puniſhment will ſtill be as far from an end as it was at the begining: for all this is but a moment to eternity; ſtill <hi>their worm dies not, neither is their fire quenched; but the ſmoke of their torment aſcends up for ever and ever, and they have no reſt day nor night.</hi> Surely this then if there were no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument might of it ſelf be ſufficient to convince us that Sin is a moſt intolerable burden, ſince it will inevitably ſink us into ſo unconceivable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs Miſery. But ſecondly that it is ſuch a burden will appear further from the conſideration of the foulneſs and loathſomneſs of it: and this is ſo exceeding great, that indeed nothing in the world is really and truly filthy and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but Sin it ſelf. For although there be many of God's creatures (as for example a Toad, or a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or the like) which by ſome ſecret antipathy in this our lapſed Eſtate we cannot chuſe but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the ſight of; yet the moſt noiſome Vermin that the Earth affords is ſo far from being filthy and ugly, that if rightly underſtood it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, being created by God for wiſe and gracious purpoſes: for Moſes tells us in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>he ſaw every thing that he had made; and behold it was very good.</hi> If therefore any of God's Creatures appear to us to be otherwiſe, it is purely through the fault of our corrupt reaſon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107594:58"/>which is apt to take a falſe eſtimate of things. But that Sin is a moſt foul and loathſom thing cannot but be granted by any one that ſeriouſly conſiders it, ſince it is moſt directly contrary and oppoſite to the Nature of God, who is the moſt perfect, wiſe, good, and glorious Being in the world; who cannot be deceived or biaſſed by any prejudice or partiality; but paſſes a true and juſt cenſure upon all things. And he hath declared in his word, that Sin is a moſt filthy and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evil, that it is a moſt offenſive ſtink in his Noſtrils; and that he abhors and hates it with an irreconcilable and eternal hatred. How pleaſant ſoever therefore Sin may ſeem to us whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is darkned, and whoſe reaſon is enſlaved and led captive by our unruly luſts and paſſion, ſo that it is of it ſelf utterly unable to judge aright of any thing it is notwithſtanding moſt certain and undeniable that Sin is the moſt foul and loathſom thing in the World, ſeeing it is pronounced to be ſo by God himſelf who is infinitely wiſe and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived and infinitely good and cannot hate any thing but what is evil. From theſe 2 conſiderations then it is ſufficiently evident that Sin is a moſt intolerable burden, both upon the account of the danger of it and the foulneſs of it. The foulneſs of it is ſuch that God is not able to endure it in his ſight: for he is of purer Eyes than to behold iniquity: and the danger of it is ſuch, that it will certainly plunge us into ſuch miſery as the heart of man is not able to conceive. He therefore that hath taken this ſtrict and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial ſurvey of Sin, and finds that himſelf is guilty of it, will ſoon be ready to cry out with <hi>David: Mine iniquities are gone over mine head:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107594:58"/>as an heavy burthen they are too heavy for me. My wounds ſtink and are corrupt, becauſe of my fooliſhneſs. I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly: I go mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the day long. For my loyns are filled with a loathſom diſeaſe; and there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh,</hi> Pſ. 38.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or he will complain with S. <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this death?</hi> Rom. 7.24. But though the caſe of every one of us be thus bad, yet it is not deſperate to any man that is thus truly ſenſible of his condition, that feels the weight of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and deſires to be eaſed of it. For behold a Deliverer is ready at hand, one that is mighty to ſave; one that is both able and willing to help us, and hath here in my Text made this gracious invitation with his own mouth to all men that are thus qualified to come unto him. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo I proceed to the ſecond thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to ſpeak of, which is the Perſon unto whom we are invited to come for help, and that is Chriſt. And here we muſt underſtand that by coming unto Chriſt is not meant any corporeal approach, as if we were obliged to ſee him with our Eyes, or to touch him with our hands: for alaſs how can we that are but worms upon earth come thus unto him who is exalted unto the Right-hand of God in the higheſt Heavens? But though we cannot come thus to him, yet we may come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to him than thus, even ſo near as to be one with him, to be <hi>members of his Body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Eph. 5.30. And this is that coming unto Chriſt, which is here meant in my Text, a coming to him and laying hold on him by a true and lively faith. This is the only way that we
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107594:59"/>can come unto Chriſt, ſo as to receive any benefit from him. For as his hands were tied while he was here upon Earth, ſo that he could not work any Miracles where he found not faith; ſo are they tied ſtill upon the ſame account now he is in Heaven; ſo that he cannot ſave us, he cannot eaſe us of our Burden, except we believe: we have his own word for it, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And if this be all that is required of us in coming to Chriſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> and to acknowledge our ſelves to be ſuch, who then ſhall not be ſaved? ſurely then the way to Heaven is much eaſier than it is generally repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be, and few there be that ſhall not find it. But our bleſſed Saviour hath aſſured us of the contrary and told us expreſly, that <hi>few there be that</hi> ſhall <hi>find it,</hi> Matth. 7.14. And therefore it is more than a bare hiſtorical faith that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us, if we will come unto Chriſt aright, ſo as to find reſt unto our ſouls: and this is plain from the words in the Verſe after my Text: <hi>Take my Yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls.</hi> Here is ſomething implied more than juſt coming unto Chriſt: for we muſt not only come to him but we muſt reſolve alſo to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, which he expects we ſhould do, if ever we look for ſalvation from him: and that is to be obedient to thoſe moſt holy Laws, and to follow as far as we are able through the Aſſiſtance of his Grace, that moſt excellent Example which in his laſt Will and Teſtament he hath left us for the Rule of our Life and Converſation. I will
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107594:59"/>not deny but that it is faith alone by which we are juſtified and ſaved: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us more than once in his Epiſtles, that <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> But then he tells us what this faith is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. It is <hi>faith which works by love,</hi> and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. he calls it <hi>the work of faith, and Labour of Love.</hi> If then faith be a work it muſt needs be more than a bare aſſent to, and belief of, the truth of the Goſpel, together with a groundleſs application of the promiſes therein contained to our ſelves; which too many men are apt to think to be a faith ſufficient to ſalvation. For what work is this, to believe the truth of a Store when there are moſt unanſwerable Arguments to prove it? though indeed it is a work, and an hard work too; the Devils work to perſwade us to apply thoſe precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which are made in that ſacred Story to our ſelves, when they do not at all concern us. Let us take heed therefore of deceiving our ſelves, and thinking that we have faith when we have it not: but if we deſire to approve our faith in the ſight of God, and Men, and Angels, and to the quiet and ſatisfaction of our own Conſciences, let us follow the advice both of S. <hi>James</hi> and S. <hi>Peter.</hi> The former tells us that <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi> and that <hi>by works Faith is made perfect.</hi> And the latter upon the ſubſtantial, and never failing, foundation of a true faith raiſes a moſt noble Structure by which we may gradually aſcend into thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Glory which our bleſſed Saviour hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all thoſe that love his appearing, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.5. <hi>Add,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godlineſs, and to godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107594:60"/>charity. For if theſe things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But he that lacketh theſe things, i. e.</hi> any one of them, <hi>is blind and cannot ſee a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old Sins. Wherefore the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brethren give Diligence to make your calling and election ſure: for if ye do theſe things ye ſhall never fall. For ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly into the everlaſting knigdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> From hence ye may plainly ſee that the faith which is here meant by coming unto Chriſt, is more than a bare belief of the truth of the Goſpel, more than a bare recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency and leaning upon Chriſt for Salvation, and applying his Merits to our ſelves as it were at a venture right or wrong, whether we have any intereſt in him or no. Such a faith as this many men truſt to, that have been ſtrangers all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the perfect Law of Liberty, by which S. <hi>James</hi> tells us that we muſt all be judged at the laſt. But the faith which our Saviour here requires in all that come unto him, implies, beſides, a full and ſteadfaſt belief of all that is contained in the Goſpel, a firm purpoſe and reſolution, and a chearful endeavour to the beſt of our power throughout the whole courſe of our Life, to be obedient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to all thoſe rules, and precepts, and Laws which the Goſpel injoyns us to perform, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that moſt holy example which our bleſſed Lord hath ſett us, ſtriving to be perfect as he was perfect; and when we have done all this, ſtill to acknowledge that we are unprofitable ſervants, utterly diſowning any Merits or Righteouſneſs in our ſelves; but deſiring with S. <hi>Paul</hi> to be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107594:60"/>
                  <hi>found in Chriſt, not having our own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. 3.9. This is a true and ſaving Faith indeed: and whoſoever thus comes unto Chriſt, may aſſure himſelf that he ſhall be heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; he ſhall moſt certainly obtain the benefit of this invitation and <hi>ſhall find reſt unto his Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this brings me to my third and laſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which is the end wherefore all that labour and are heavy laden with the burthen of their Sins, are invited to come unto Chriſt: and that is that he may give them reſt. Ye have already heard that there is no burden ſo intolerable as that of Sin; and the reſt which Chriſt here promiſes to give to them that come unto him in that manner, which I have ſhewed you, is a freedom from this burden, and from all the dreadfull conſequents and effects of it; a freedom from the anguiſh of an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, from the inſupportable troubles of a wounded Spirit, that is ſmitten with <hi>the arrows of the Almighty</hi> from the wrath of God, and from the Torments of Hell; from the guilt of Sin, and from its puniſhment. And this Chriſt doth by taking the burden of their Sins upon himſelf and making a full ſatisfaction for them unto the Divine Juſtice. For the <hi>Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.6. And <hi>God made him to be ſin for us,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, <hi>who knew no Sin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And he that by a true faith applies theſe Merits of Chriſt's Death, and paſſion to himſelf, he hath already obtained this reſt which Chriſt here promiſes; he is delivered from the burden of his Sins, and from that vengeance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107594:61"/>which is due unto them. This reſt therefore is, in a word, our juſtification in the ſight of God by which purely for the ſake of the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, we are acquitted and abſolved of all our Sins, and are reconciled to God. <hi>Being juſtified by faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5.1. This is that peace which paſſes all underſtanding; a peace which nothing can diſturb or interrupt, but it will always continue firm and unſhaken among all the changes, and chances of this mortal life: and when we ſhall have moſt need of it it will ſtand us in greateſt ſtead. When we walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death it will not leave us; but will bear us company even before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Chriſt, and will enable us to lift up our Heads with joy in that great day when the whole World ſhall tremble, and will at the laſt conduct us into thoſe glorious regions of reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Prince of peace hath purchaſed for us. Thus ye ſee who they be that are here invited, unto whom they are invited, and for what end. Sad and diſconſolate Sinners that are oppreſſed with the weight of their Sins are invited by Chriſt, to come and caſt that inſupportable burden upon him who alone is able to bear it and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to receive from him the moſt bleſſed reſt and peace imaginable. What remains then but that with moſt ardent prayers we continually beſiege the Throne of Grace, and beg of God that he would open our eyes by the Grace of his H. Spirit (without whom we can do nothing that is good) that ſo we may diſcern both the Miſery of Sin with which by nature we are laden, and the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that peace which by the grace of Chriſt,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107594:61"/>we may obtain. And when we once do diſcern theſe things let us immediately without any delay run unto Chriſt for help. Let us not ſeek for this peace from any one elſe but from him who alone hath promiſed it to us, and who alone is able to give it us. Let us not ſeek it in the vain Pomps and Pleaſures of this preſent World: for all that this world can do for us without this peace will do us no good; and with it all that it can do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us will do us no harm. Let us not (as the Papiſts do) ſeek for it from any merit or right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in our ſelves: for <hi>all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags:</hi> neither let us (as they do likewiſe) ſeek for it to Saints, or Angels, or Archangels: for the Angels refuſe our Worſhip, and own themſelves to be but our Fellow-ſervants; as is evident by two plain inſtances in the Revelation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.10. and 22.9. And as for the Saints, <hi>Abraham</hi> though he be the father of the faithfull, yet <hi>he is ignorant of us, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>knows us not.</hi> Nay the bleſſed Virgin her ſelf, though the Papiſts blaſphemouſly call her the Queen of Heaven, and pray to her not only to intreat but to command her Son in their behalf, doubtleſs could ſhe hear ſuch Prayers as theſe, and had leave to anſwer them, ſhe would preſently ſend ſuch Perſons as theſe to Chriſt, and give them no other anſwer from Heaven than what ſhe gave to the Servants at the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Feaſt in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> while ſhe was upon earth, <hi>John</hi> 2.5. <hi>Whatſoever he ſaith unto you do it.</hi> Let us therefore acquieſs in this anſwer of hers, as if it were an Oracle from Heaven; and inſtead of ſeeking either to her or any other Perſon for ſalvation, let us come unto <hi>the Lamb of God which taketh away the Sins of the World,</hi> even to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107594:62"/>Chriſt himſelf who hath invited us and whatſoever he ſaith unto us in his Goſpel let us do it. Thus, if we come unto him we ſhall be ſure to find him ready to receive us, and to perform unto us this gracious promiſe which he hath here made in my Text: he will give us in this World peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and in the World to come everlaſting joy and reſt in his Heavenly Kingdom.</p>

               <p>THESE words are ſuch a plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Prohibition of Angel-worſhip, (and conſequently of Saint-worſhip too) that it is one of the greateſt wonders in the World, that there ſhould be found in it a Chriſtian Church, that ſtiles her ſelf Catholick, (and that in ſo arrogant a manner as to appropriate that Title to her ſelf excluſively to all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107594:63"/>in the World beſides) and yet in open and hoſtile Oppoſition of this Text of Scripture ſhould not only allow of the Worſhip of Angels and Saints as lawful, but proceed ſo far as to impoſe it upon all Men as a neceſſary Article of Faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematizing all that will not join with her in it. But theſe things muſt be, that the Scriptures may be fulfilled. For certainly whoſoever laying aſide all Prejudice, and Partiality, and Hypocriſie, devoutly and ſeriouſly conſults the Holy Oracles of God, will find in the Writings of the New Teſtament, as plain and punctual a Prediction and Deſcription of Antichriſt, both as to the time and manner of his Coming, and his Behaviour and Reception in the World, as in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament there is of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and ſeeing both exactly foretold, will not think it a greater wonder, that by one part of the World the Man of Sin ſhould be worſhipped as a Saint, than that by another the Holy One of God ſhould be rejected as an Impoſtour. For the bleſſed Spirit of Truth, who alone can guide us into all Truth, hath told us <hi>expreſly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Daemons.</hi> That there ſhall ariſe a great one in the Earth, that ſhall <hi>oppoſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt himſelf above all, that is called God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that he as God, ſhall ſit in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. Whoſe coming ſhall be after the working of</hi> Satan, <hi>with all Power, and Signs, and lying Wonders, and with all Deceivableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh; becauſe they received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved. And that for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107594:63"/>believe a lye, that they all might be damned who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not the Truth, but had pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> And ſince this Prophecy muſt needs be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulled, it was highly neceſſary that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould forewarn us to beware of all thoſe falſe Doctrines, and corrupt and abominable Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which this grand Impoſtour ſhould endeavour to obtrude upon the Church of Chriſt as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation; one of which the Apoſtle cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions us againſt in the words of my Text. <hi>Let no Man beguile you of your Reward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Text in the Original is ſomething difficult, and hath therefore occaſioned ſome difference in Tranſlations; though none ſo great, but that any one of them that I have ſeen, and I have conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral) contains as direct a Prohibition of the Worſhipping of Angels, as the Greek it ſelf: For whether we render the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Let no Man judge againſt you,</hi> as <hi>Beza,</hi> or, <hi>Let no Man condemn you,</hi> as <hi>Diodate,</hi> or, <hi>Let no Man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or govern you,</hi> as the French; or, <hi>Let no Man ſeduce you,</hi> as the Vulgar Latin, and the Rhemiſh Tranſlation; or, <hi>Let no Man beguile you of your Reward,</hi> as our Tranſlatours have rendered it, it comes all to one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that no Man upon Earth hath any Power to impoſe upon us the Worſhip of Angels; but whoſoever goeth about to do ſo puts a dangerous cheat upon us, to the hazarding of our Eternal Salvation. The main difference that I can obſerve conſiſts in joining the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as it may be indifferently) either to the preceeding or following words. If we join it to the words that go before it, the Senſe will be this; <hi>Let no man beguile you of your Reward,</hi> or condemn, or maſter, or ſeduce you willingly, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107594:64"/>uſurping over you a Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which was never committed unto him; and ſo they will look with a malignant Aſpect upon his Holineſſes pretended Supremacy. If we join it to the words that follow it, the Senſe will be, as our Tranſlatours have rendered it; <hi>in a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary humility,</hi> or <hi>being a voluntary in humility;</hi> and ſo the Worſhip of Angels will appear to be but Will-worſhip, having no Foundation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my ſelf to our Engliſh Tranſlation, which in my Judgment is of all that I have ſeen, the moſt faithfully rendered according to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and out of the words of my Text I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this; that no Man whatſoever hath any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to impoſe upon us the Worſhip of Angels being a thing abſolutely unlawful and repugnant to the Will of God, for the proof of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (beſides ſome other Arguments which we may produce) the Apoſtle furniſhes us with four in my Text. 1. This Worſhip of Angels is a falſe and voluntary Humility, a Will-worſhip invented by Man, not enjoined by God. 2. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a real and carnal Pride: He that goes about to impoſe it upon us, <hi>intrudes into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen, vainly puffed up by his fleſhly mind.</hi> 3. It is highly injurious to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Honour and Prerogative of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: they that are guilty of it <hi>hold not the Head.</hi> 4. It is deſtructive and deadly to our own Souls, and the End of it will be Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for he that prevails with us to join in this Worſhip, <hi>beguiles us of our Reward.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Worſhip of Angels is a falſe and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Humility, a Will-worſhip invented by Man,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107594:64"/>and not enjoyned by God. Of all the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which Satan is wont to aſſault our Souls, there are none ſo dangerous as thoſe which he offers to us under colour of Religion. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Baits of ſenſual Pleaſures of worldly Profit, or Honour, and the like, ſinell ſo rank of the old Serpent, that he that hath but half an Eye may diſcern that there is an Hook under them; and it is merely the Predominance of his Corruptions that prevails with any Man to ſwallow it. But when he aſſumes the Habit of an Angel of Light, when inſtead of tempting us to Vice he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to us ſome extraordinary Grace and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as being not yet ſully underſtood nor practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by us, according to the true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, it is not every Man that will look for a cloven Foot, nor be able to diſcover it under ſuch a ſanctified Diſguiſe, and it is no marvel, that even ſome learned Men have been impoſed upon by the Stratagem. Now of all thoſe Excellent Graces which the Goſpel requires of us, there is none more lovely and amiable, none that doth more adorn and beautifie our Souls, and renders them more pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of God through the Merits of Chriſt, than Humility; and therefore no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation could be more likely to prevail with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inclinable to Devotion, than one that was gilded with the ſpecious Pretence and Shew of ſo incomparable a Virtue. Upon this plauſible Foundation the grand Enemy of our Salvation, eſtabliſhed the Worſhip of Angels among ſome Hereticks very early, even in the Apoſtle's Time; which was the occaſion of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s giving the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> this neceſſary Caution againſt it here in my
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107594:65"/>Text. <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon the place informs us that they that maintained it neceſſary to obſerve the Law introduced alſo the Worſhip of angels affirming that the Law was given by them. And this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs was long practiſed in <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Piſidia.</hi> Wherefore the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (which is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Phrygia</hi>) made a Canon on purpoſe to prohibit praying to Angels. And even to this day, ſaith he, there are to be ſeen amongſt them and their neighbours, Oratories of S. <hi>Michael.</hi> Now ſaith he they did this upon pretence of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſaying, That whereas God Almighty was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, incomprehenſible, and inacceſſible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought humbly to ſue for his favour through the interceſſion of Angels. Now I would fain know the difference betwixt that Worſhip of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls Catholick (and hath declared to be good and profitable for us) and this which <hi>Theodoret</hi> condemns as Heretical, and was anathematized by the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council. For my part I can ſee no difference at all: for as this honeſt Father hath (no doubt faithfully) ſtated the caſe, the <hi>Phrygians</hi> (had they but known them) might as juſtly have pleaded the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for their Excuſe as ever the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> could, only the former were ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to venture their Hereſie into the World naked; theſe later are ſo crafty, that they have done what they can to palliate and clothe it: but the Miſchief is, the Garment they have beſtowed upon it is ſo exceeding thin, and thred-bare, that it doth rather expoſe than conceal its Deformity. Well then the pretence for Angel-worſhip was of old, and is to this day, Humility: the Patrons of it tell us that for us miſerable Sinners directly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107594:65"/>and immediately to addreſs our ſelves, in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, to the moſt ſacred and infinite Majeſty of God is too great a preſumption, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it becomes us rather humbly to implore the help and aſſiſtance of the bleſſed Angels and Saints, (and eſpecially of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who as a Mother cannot chuſe but be very powerfull with her Son) and to beg of theſe holy Perſons, that are ſo gracious in the Court of Heaven, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Prayers and Supplications, and to make known our wants unto God; and that by thus doing we perform an acceptable piece of Humility, paying both to God and to the Holy Angels and Saints, that Honour which is due reſpectively unto them both, aſcribing unto God a Superiour, to the Angels and Saints, an inferiour, though to both a religious, Worſhip. This I take to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this point, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Reaſon and Ground of it, which (as they pretend) is Humility: whether it be ſo or no, we are now to enquire. And here I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the word Humility in its largeſt and moſt comprehenſive ſenſe; but only as it ſignifies our humble Deportment towards God in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip of him, which cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it ought, in Truth and ſincerity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humbling our ſelves before his Divine Majeſty, even as low as the Duſt out of which we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, acknowledging his Supreme and abſolute Power and Soveraignty over us, and our neceſſary Dependence upon him, from whom, and <hi>in whom we live, and move and have our Being.</hi> And ſo the queſtion in ſhort will be this, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or we and the reſt of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, that have juſtly ſeparated our ſelves
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107594:66"/>from her, as from a Church that is full of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and is Schiſmatical from the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Holy Catholick Church of Chriſt, ſhew the moſt ſincere and acceptable Humility unto God in our Devotions and Religious Worſhip; and the caſe is ſo plain, that one would a think few words might decide the Controverſie among Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are not more zealous, and induſtrious in the Defence of a party, than of the Truth. But now the miſchief is, that we Hereticks (as they are pleaſed to call us) will never ſubmit to the Judgment of any one but God himſelf for the Deciſion of any of theſe Controverſies in Religion, and are ſo partial as to be guided by one plain Text of Scripture though there ſhould be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places in the Fathers that ſeem to contradict it. This they take very ill from us: but for all that, we ſhall confidently appeal to the ſame Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal ſtill, at which we are ſure no man ſhall ever be condemned, but for the Injuſtice of his Cauſe. Now nothing is more evident in Scripture, than that we cannot demonſtrate our Humility to God better, than by a ſtrict and punctual Obedience and an intire Reſignation to his Will in all things, as he hath revealed it to us in his Word. This is ſo certain a Maxime, that I cannot believe any Man is ſo impudent as directly to call it in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though, indirectly, I know there are many that do: and therefore I ſhall preſume upon it as granted. And hence will follow theſe two things. 1. That whoſoever directs all his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip wholly and ſolely to that Object unto which God in his Word hath commanded him to direct it, excluſively to all other Objects, is, in that reſpect, inſallibly ſecure of paying unto God
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107594:66"/>as much Humility as he requires of him. 2. That whoſoever preſumes to direct any part of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip to any Object unto which God hath not commanded him to direct it; though in ſo doing he intends (and that never ſo ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to honour God the more by it, yet can have no Aſſurance that he doth not thereby diſhonour him; and if God hath expreſly prohibited that Object ſo to be Worſhiped, I can not ſee how he can excuſe himſelf from groſs Idolatry. I ſhall illuſtrate theſe two propoſitions by the Example of <hi>Saul,</hi> which one would think ſhould be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warning to deter any man from interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of God's poſitive Commands otherwiſe than according to the direct ſence and meaning of the Words, in their moſt natural and proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. When God ſent that unhappy King to deſtroy <hi>Amalek,</hi> he commanded him in theſe words; <hi>Go, and ſmite Amaleck and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not; but ſlay both Man and Woman, Infant and Suckling, Ox and Sheep, Camel and Aſs.</hi> The ſenſe of this Command ſeems to be plain enough, that God would not have one Man, Woman or Child, or Beaſt ſaved throughout all the Country, but every one of them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And if <hi>Saul</hi> had done ſo he might have been ſecure, that he had obeyed God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Whereas, if he ſpared but one of the Men, though it were the King himſelf, and a few of the beſt of the Sheep and Oxen, though he deſigned them for a ſacrifice to the Lord; in ſo doing he could not poſſibly be ſure that he had obeyed it; at the beſt he could but hope that he had done it: but ye know that in doing of it he highly offended God, in ſo much that he deprived
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107594:67"/>him of his Kingdom for it. Now to apply this to our preſent buſineſs, God hath in Scripture given us a ſtrict command to direct all our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip to himſelf only, and to no other Object whatſoever. It is our Saviours Anſwer to the Devil, and it may ſerve for an Anſwer to all his Agents unto the Worlds End) <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Matt. 4.10. Now it is demonſtrably evident to any man, that is in his right Wits that he that directs all his Prayers and Religious Worſhip ſolely and immediately unto God himſelf, and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Object, doth not therein tranſgreſs this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; and it is as demonſtrably evident, that whoſoever directs his Prayers and Religious Worſhip to any other Object but God, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pretence (though it be to honour God the more by it) cannot be ſure that he doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tranſgreſs this Commandment. If then we had no other Text in Scripture but this one to be guided by in this caſe, it is manifeſt that we who (underſtanding theſe words of our Saviour in the ſtricteſt ſenſe) refuſe to give Religious Worſhip to any one but God himſelf, cannot thereby incur his Diſpleaſure; ſince he cannot condemn us for it, without directly giving himſelf the lye, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his own Law: whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> interpreting this Law without any warrant for it, in a larger ſenſe (<hi>viz.</hi> as not reſtraining all Religious Worſhip ſolely unto God; but only prohibiting the giving of it to wicked Spirits, or to the Heathen Gods or Idols, and the like) and thereupon preſuming to give ſuch Worſhip, though in an inferiour Degree, to the Holy Angels and Saints, is altogether as inexcuſable in ſo doing, as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107594:67"/>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> was in his expedition againſt the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> But though <hi>Saul</hi>'s Fault was great enough as it was; yet it would have been much greater, if God in the Commiſſion which he gave him had expreſly named <hi>Agag,</hi> and forbidden him to ſave even the King himſelf, and he had ſpared him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: certainly this had been a willful and obſtinate Rebellion againſt the Divine Command. And yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ventures as far as this, and curſes all the World that will not joyn with her in it. For God hath not only in general forbidden us to direct our Religious Worſhip to any other Object but himſelf only, but he hath moreover in expreſs Terms commanded us parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly not to Worſhip Angels in theſe words of my Text. <hi>Let no man beguile you of your Reward in a voluntary Humility, and Worſhiping of Angels:</hi> nay and hath alſo given us two plain inſtances, by way of example, to ſatisfie us that the Angels themſelves abhor ſuch Worſhip, and dare no more to accept of it, than Man may dare ſafely to give it to them. For in the 19th, and 22d, Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> when S. <hi>John</hi> ſell at the Angels ſeet to Worſhip him, the Angel immediately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids him, and reproves him in both places for it in the ſame words; <hi>See thou do it not for I am thy fellow-Servant. Worſhip God.</hi> And yet all this will not ſatisfie them, that the Worſhip of Angels is unlawful, and it ſeems God cannot make a Law ſo plain (even though he interpret it, and make it a judged caſe by an example) but the Schoolmen will find out ſome ſubtile Diſtinctions, or other to evade the force of it. And yet all theſe Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, may be eaſily baffled (and they will be ſo at the Day of Judgment) with this one queſtion,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107594:68"/>
                  <hi>Who hath required this at your hand.</hi> They are not able to give any tolerable Anſwer to it now. For in the New Teſtament they confeſs that There is neither any direct Command nor Example for the Worſhip of Angels. In the Old they can find ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Command for it, and all that they inſiſt upon there is the Examples of ſome holy Men that did worſhip Angels, without being reproved for it, which they think is a plain Argument, that ſuch Worſhip was not then unlawful, and conſequently cannot be ſo now. But all this may be anſwered in two words. For firſt, it is the opinion of ſome of the Fathers, and of moſt of the beſt Expoſitours of Scripture, that it was our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, that appeared to thoſe holy Men in the Old Teſtament: and then it is no wonder, that he received Divine Worſhip from them without giving them a check for it. But ſecondly, though we ſhould grant (which we do not) that before the Coming of Chriſt the Worſhip of Angels was Lawful; yet it doth not at all follow that it is ſo ſtill, ſince God hath ſince expreſsly forbiden it, and declared it to be unlawful both by Precept and Example. And therefore if they will anſwer ingenuouſly to this Queſtion, <hi>Who hath required this at your hand?</hi> they muſt confeſs that it was not God, but themſelves; that it is a Will worſhip of their own deviſing. And if ſo, I am ſure that <hi>Saul</hi> had every whit as fair a Pretence for his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rcy, in ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> as they have for their voluntary Humility, in worſhipping of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: and God deliver us from ſuch lame Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thus much of the Apoſtles firſt Argument againſt the worſhipping of Angels. It is a falſe and voluntary Humility; a Will-worſhip, as he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107594:68"/>expreſly calls it, and other ſuch like humane Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, in the laſt Verſe of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is this; It proceeds from a real and carnal Pride: he that goes about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it upon us <hi>intrudes into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen, vainly puffed up by his fleſhly Mind.</hi> We have been long enquiring after Humility, and have miſſed of it after all our ſearch; for it proves a falſe one: but we need not look ſo long for the Pride of the Impoſers of this Worſhip, for that will ſoon diſcover it ſelf to be a real one. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Pride is very often found, and eaſily diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the falſe Mask of Humility; and we know who would never ſtoop ſo low as to ſtile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Servus Servorum Dei,</hi> if it were not to add a greater luſtre to his more beloved Title of <hi>Chriſti Vicarius;</hi> which how pleaſing ſoever it may ſeem in Latin, I am ſure hath a very unlucky ſound in Greek. For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as properly ſignifies <hi>Chriſti Vicarius,</hi> as <hi>Chriſti Adverſarius:</hi> and it is not improbable but that the Holy Ghoſt made choice of this word on purpoſe to point at a Perſon unto whom it might be applicable in either ſence; one who under pretence of being Chriſt's Vicar ſhould indeed be his Enemy. Now the Pride of the impoſer of his Worſhip is ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that I need not go about to expoſe it, ſince every own knows that <hi>he exalts himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> not only in a myſtical, but even in a literal, ſence. For as if it were a ſmall matter to tread upon the Necks of Kings and Emperours and to kick their Crowns off of their Heads at his pleaſure, he ventures once in his life (<hi>viz.</hi> at his Inauguration) to come as near as poſſible to the trampling upon Chriſt himſelf pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107594:69"/>his Feet upon the high Altar eſteeming his Maſters Throne no better than his footſtool, and himſelf <hi>as God ſitting in the Temple of God, and ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</hi> This I think is a ſufficient Demonſtration of an unparallelled Pride in one that is <hi>vainly puffed up by his fleſhly mind.</hi> I might as eaſily ſhew, that he <hi>intrudes into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen;</hi> whilſt by counterfeit Miracles, fabulous Legends, and ſuch like Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, he endeavours to perſwade us, that he is thoroughly acquainted with all the Tranſactions of the other World; telling us that the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and ſaints do not only pray for us; but that they alſo can hear our Prayers; nay that any one of them can hear the Prayers of ten thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons; though they all pray at the ſame inſtant for ſeveral things, in ſeveral Places or Countries of the World. Nay, and he can tell us too unto what Angel, or Saint, it is moſt proper for us to direct our Prayers in every particular Exigence: of all which matters S. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had been caught up into the third Heaven, either was utterly ignorant or moſt unpardonably negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, in fourteen ſeveral Epiſtles never to acquaint us with this comfortable Doctrine. Nay, which is worſe, he ſeems directly to contradict it as if he were as obſtinate an Heretick as we are, affirming poſitively, that <hi>there is one God, and one Mediatour between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. And ſo I ſhall paſs to the Apoſtles third Argument againſt the worſhip of Angels, which is this.</p>
               <p>It is highly injurious to the incommunicable Honour and Prerogative of this one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107594:69"/>that are guilty of it hold <hi>not the Head:</hi> that is by offering ſuch a manifeſt affront to the bleſſed Son of God they do in effect deny him to be the ſole Head of his Church, cutting themſelves off from being Members of his Body, and bringing upon themſelves a moſt dreadful Anathema. The Office of a Mediatour between God and Man is an Office of ſo high and Divine a Nature that no Perſon could be capable of it, but one who was both God and Man. For it was neceſſary that whoſoever undertook this Office ſhould not only make ſatisfaction for our Sins, but ſhould alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Prayers, and preſent them unto God, and render them acceptable unto him through his Interceſſion. Now not to inſiſt upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe two things, it is plain from what I have already ſaid, that the latter of them (<hi>viz.</hi> to receive Prayers and divine Worſhip) is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Prerogative of God, of which none can upon any Account whatſoever be capable but himſelf only. God the Father therefore having conferred this high Honour upon his only begotten Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who as he was Man, had purchaſed it by his Death and Paſſion, and as he was God equal with the Father was qualified for it, without any injury to the Divine Majeſty; I ſay, God the Father having conferred upon his Son this Honour, not only of being our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but our Advocate alſo, to receive and preſent our Prayers, and to make interceſſion for us, and having not given us the leaſt Intimation in his word that he allows any part of this Honour to any of the holy Angels or Saints, what can be more plain than that they who pray to Angels and Saints as Mediatours, at leaſt, of Interceſſion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107594:70"/>with Chriſt, do thereby highly affront him by joyning Co-partners with him in this incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Honour of being the only Mediatour both of Redemption and Interceſſion between God and Man. And that our bleſſed Saviour is ſo, the Scripture moſt plainly and frequently declares. <hi>There is but one God, and one Mediatour between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Place above-mentioned, where it is obſervable, that this Office of Mediatour between God and Men, is an Office ſo divinely glorious and honourable, that the Apoſtle thinks it no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to mention it with the ſame Reverence and Reſpect that he doth God himſelf; <hi>There is one God, and one Mediatour.</hi> And indeed ſo well he might; Since this Mediatour is God, and <hi>Sits</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>with his Father in his Throne, being able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever lives to make interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.25. Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> produce but any one plain Text of Scripture to Satisfie us that there is any other Mediatour (whether of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or Interceſſion) between God and men, beſides the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and we will confeſs our ſelves to be (as they are pleaſed to call us) groſs Hereticks: but if they can produce no ſuch Text let us repoſe all our Truſt and Confidence in that one Mediatour whom God in his Word hath pronounced to be ſo, aſſuring our ſelves, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever joyn other Mediatours together with him praying upon that Account either to Angels or Saints, yea even to the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf, by ſo doing offer a manifeſt Affront to this one Mediatour between God and Men, cutting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off from Chriſt, and <hi>not holding the Head.</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:107594:70"/>
               </p>
               <p>And now I need ſay very little concerning our Apoſtles laſt Argument againſt the Worſhip of Angels, which is this, that it is deſtructive and deadly to our own Souls, and the End of it will be Damnation; for he that impoſes this Worſhip upon us <hi>beguiles us of our Reward.</hi> I ſay I need not inſiſt upon this, ſince it is ſufficiently evident from what I have already delivered. For if the Worſhip of Angels be a falſe and voluntary Humility, a Will-Worſhip flatly repugnant to the Word of God; if it proceed from a real and carnal Pride in the Impoſers of it, who <hi>intrude into thoſe things which they have not ſeen, vainly pufft up by their fleſhly mind;</hi> if it be injurious to the royal and incommunicable Prerogative of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is to be the ſole Mediatour between God and Men, inſomuch that whoſoever owns any other Mediatour beſides him (whether it be Saint or Angel) doth thereby in effect renounce his Saviour, <hi>not holding the Head:</hi> then certainly this Worſhip of Angels muſt needs be deadly to our Souls, and whoſoever impoſes it upon us, <hi>beguiles us of our reward,</hi> and brings us into apparent Danger of Damnation. Hence then it is evident, that had we no other Reaſon (as we have many and great ones) this one were abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to juſtifie our Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> wherein the Worſhip of Angels and Saints is not only allowed, but impoſed upon all its Members, as a neceſſary Term of Communion, contrary to the expreſs Word of God, and the Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, for about three hundred years after Chriſt. This, I ſay, is ſufficient to prove our Church to be herein Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apoſtolical, and theirs Heretical and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107594:71"/>Schiſmatical from the Catholick Church of Chriſt, cut off from his Body, <hi>and not holding the Head;</hi> that is not the true Head, which is Chriſt, though they have a falſe one that hath uſurped that Title, wherein they have literally fulfilled theſe words of my Text. <hi>Stand faſt therefore,</hi> Brethren, <hi>in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</hi> Ye ſee that the Worſhip of Angels and Saints is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Sinful: let no man therefore impoſe it upon you neither by fraud nor violence, ſince who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth ſo beguiles you of your Reward, that <hi>crown of life</hi> which our Lord hath promiſed to <hi>give</hi> unto all that are <hi>faithful unto death.</hi>

And as they were highly eſteemed of by the People, ſo they had alſo a very good opinion of themſelves: they <hi>loved the uppermoſt Rooms at feaſts, and the chief Seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and to be called of Men Rabbi:</hi> they deſpiſed all other Perſons in compariſon of themſelves, and as they ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Seat, ſo no doubt but they expected as honourable a place in the Boſom of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107594:72"/>
                  <hi>Abraham.</hi> But tho' this fair outſide of theirs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very lovely, and took much with the People, yet our Saviour ſaw through it, and diſcerned that there was nothing but Rottenneſs and Hypocriſie in their Hearts; that though they made clean the outſide of the Cup and of the Platter, yet within they were full of Extortion and Exceſs; that though they faſted often and made long Prayers, yet it was only for a pretence to devour Widows houſes; that though they paid Tithe of Mint and Aniſe, and Cummin yet they omitted the weightier Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith, and that the Gate of Heaven would prove too ſtreight to give any Entrance to their broad Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries, and large Borders of their Garments: and therefore he often charges his Diſciples to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of treading in their ſteps, not to acquieſce in ſuch a vain and Hypocritical Oſtentation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which however it may gain the Applauſe of Men, who can ſee no further than the outſide, will be nothing worth when it comes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined before his Tribunal, but to labour for Sincerity and Pureneſs of Heart without which no Man ſhall ſee God: <hi>For I ſay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the handling of which words I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, 1. to ſhew you what the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees was, which will not be thought worthy to be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven. 2. What manner of Righteouſneſs ours muſt be, that will procure us an entrance thither. 1. For the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, if we examine it by the Character which the Holy Evangeliſts give us of it, we ſhall find it extreamly faulty: and indeed it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe it to be otherwiſe, when we conſider how
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107594:72"/>many ſharp Reproofs and dreadfull Woes, are denounced againſt it by our Saviour. The chief Particulars which render it faulty and deficient are theſe. 1. Their Righteouſneſs could not be acceptable in the ſight of God, for as much as in general they had a very falſe Notion of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law of God, which they interpreted only in the literal Sence of the words, and thought that it extended only to outward actions, but reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to the inward Thoughts and Intentions of the mind. So long as they waſhed their Hands they regarded not the foulneſs of their Heart, and ſo long as they kept themſelves free from any open and external Breach of the Commandments they thought themſelves innocent, though their mind was never ſo much ſet upon wickedneſs. So long as they abſtained from open Adultery, they thought they might luſt after a Woman, and ſtill be chaſt. So long as they kept their Hands from ſhedding any Blood they thought it no ſin, or at leaſt a ſmall and venial one, ſuch as God would take no notice of, to hate their Brother in their Heart. So long as they did not bear falſe witneſs againſt their Neighbour before a Judge in open Court they thought it no Crime to backbite and ſlander him, and that they might ſecurely blaſt his Reputation and wound his good Name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to their own Souls. So long as they abſtained from plain Theft, and kept their Hands from picking and ſtealing, they thought that, like the Prieſt and the Levite in the Parable, they might innocently paſs by their Neighbour whom they ſaw wounded by Thieves, and that no Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation lay upon them to relieve him in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. Thus they groſly erred in their Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107594:73"/>of the Law, which reaches not only our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but our words and our thoughts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines our Tongues and our Hearts as well as our Hands. Such Commandments as theſe they taught to be the leaſt Commandments, that the Breach of them was a very light and trivial ſin, and that for an idle Word or for a luſtful or malitious thought or Intention, provided that it broke not out into Action, there was no fear of Damnation. But our Saviour paſſes a very ſevere ſentence upon them for teaching this Doctrine, in the verſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before my Text, <hi>Whoſoever</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and ſhall teach Men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven; that is, he ſhall not be accounted worthy to enter into that Kingdom.</hi> And then he confutes this falſe Doctrine of theirs, in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches of it in the following part of the Chapter. <hi>Ye have heard,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not kill, and whoſoever ſhall kill ſhall be in danger of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but I ſay unto you, that whoſoever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe ſhall be in danger of the Judgment. Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery; but I ſay unto you, that whoſoever looketh on a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to luſt after her hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart. Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not forſwear they ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths: but I ſay unto you, Swear not at all: but let your Commuunicatian be, Yea, yea: Nay, nay: for whoſoever is more than theſe cometh of Evil. Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy: but I ſay unto
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107594:73"/>you Love your Enemies; bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> This then was the firſt thing wherein the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees was deficient: They miſunderſtood the ſenſe and meaning of the Law which our Saviour in this Sermon of his Reſtores to it ſelf, and interprets in its full and proper La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And ſecondly, as it muſt needs be that <hi>Uno abſurdo dato mille ſequuntur,</hi> upon this firſt falſe principle they built a ſecond, and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the Senſe of the Law to ſo narrow a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, they thereupon concluded that they were able to keep and perform it to a Title without any Supernatural Grace and Aſſiſtance from Heaven. And indeed if this Conſtruction of the Law had been true, it is poſſible that this Concluſion which they drew from it might have been ſo too; for if the Law had required no more of us than the bare abſtaining from thoſe outward Acts of Adultery and Murder, and Theft, and Perjury, and the like, which in expreſs Terms it forbids, perhaps then we might have fulfilled it by our own ſtrength. But when a wanton Glance is Adultery, when a revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Thought is Murder, when Uſury (or Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at leaſt) is Theft, when not giving to the Poor is ſtealing from the Lord, when a tatling Tongue bears falſe witneſs, and every idle word is to be accounted for at the Day of Judgment, who then can pretend to innocence? <hi>who then can ſay,</hi> that <hi>he hath made his Heart clean, and that he is pure from his Sin?</hi> No, the beſt of Men muſt then be forced to acknowledge himſelf to be a debtor to the Law, that he falls more than ſeven times in a day, and that there is not a juſt Man upon Earth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107594:74"/>that doth good and ſins not. And yet that the Phariſees had this fond opinion of themſelves, is plain from the Parable of that proud Phariſee that juſtified himſelf in his Prayer to God Almighty, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. <hi>God, I thank thee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, unjuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican. I faſt twice in the week, I give Tythes of all that I poſſeſs;</hi> and from the confident Anſwer of the young Man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20. who when our Saviour ſhewed him that the way to enter into Life was to keep the Commandments and what thoſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, preſently replies, <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my youth:</hi> but all this while though he thought that he had exactly kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the ſecond Table he underſtood not the meaning of thoſe of the firſt; he knew not that Covetouſneſs was Idolatry; for when our Saviour to compleat his Righteouſneſs and make him perfect, exhorts him to ſell all that he hath, and give to the poor, and to come and follow him, though he promiſed him the Recompence of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven, yet <hi>he went away ſorrowful; for he had great Poſſeſſions</hi> upon Earth, and was loath to part with them. But, thirdly, they ſtay'd not here, but they proceeded a ſtep further, and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained that falſe Opinion, That they were able to perform a perfect Obedience to the Law, they thereupon perſwaded themſelves, that that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of theirs was meritorious in the Sight of God, and they boldly juſtified themſelves upon the account of their own Works: and arrogantly boaſted of them even to God himſelf, as ye may ſee by the inſtance I but now mentioned of the Phariſee that truſted in his own Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107594:74"/>and deſpiſed the Publican. Fourthly, this good Opinion they had of themſelves, puft them up with ſo much pride, and vain Glory that they ſcorned and deſpiſed all Men that were not of their own Sect. They were ſo well ſatisfied, and pleaſed with their own virtues that they took no care to examine their own hearts, but they made it their buſineſs to invade the Prerogative of God, to ſearch the hearts of other Men, and one of the moſt remarkable Inſtances of their Piety was their forwardneſs to cenſure and condemn the Lives and Converſations, of their Neighbours. Let a Man behave himſelf never ſo innocently, and blameleſly, both towards God, and towards Man, yet if he was not one of them, he muſt paſs for a Sinner. The Temperance of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, if it be tried at their bar, would be judged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his being poſſeſſed with a Devil, and the free and chearful Converſation of our Saviour to be Gluttony, and Wine-bibbing, Friendſhip and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Publicans, and Sinners. Fifthly, they did all their good Works for an ill End and Purpoſe, out of a vain-glorious Deſire to gain the Applauſe of Men: for this end they made long Prayers in the Synagogues and in the Corners of the Streets, in the moſt publick places they could find, that they might be ſeen of Men, and perhaps none at all in their Cloſet. For this end they made broad their Phylacteries and enlarged the Borders of their Garments, diſfigured their faces when they faſted, and ſounded a Trumpet before they did their Alms; they put on demure and ſanctified Looks, that the People might have their piety in admiration, when all the while it was nothing but groſs hypocriſie, and they made Religion only a ſtalking horſe to their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107594:75"/>worldly intereſt. Sixthly and laſtly, they preferred their own Traditions before the written Word of God, upon which account they are ſharply reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do you tranſgreſs the commandment of God by your tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For God commanded ſaying, Honour thy Father and Mother, and he that curſeth Father or Mother let him die the death. But ye ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his Father or his Mother, it is a gift by whatſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me, and honour not his Father or his Mother, he ſhall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</hi> Among theſe traditions of theirs were thoſe of waſhing of Cups and of Pots and of Brazen Veſſels and of tables, but above all that which they obſerved with the greateſt preciſeneſs and ſtrictneſs imaginable was their waſhing of their Hands before they eat, which as the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> tells us upon that occaſion they held to be ſo neceſſary and indiſpenſable a duty that one of their <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſaith, That he that takes meat with unwaſhed Hands is worthy of Death, and that the ſame perſon being in Priſon and having ſome water given him for his uſe to waſh and to drink, having accidentally ſpilt one half of it he waſhed his Hands in the Remainder, thinking it more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to do ſo than to drink, and to die, than to violate the tradition of his Anceſtours. This is, in brief, the Summ and Subſtance of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, as we find it deſcribed to us in the holy Scriptures, and if we mark it narrowly and conſider on the one hand the great veneration they had for unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, their falſe and corrupt interpretation of the holy Scriptures and their great confidence and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107594:75"/>truſt in the merits of their own works, and on the other hand their raſh and intolerable cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ungoverned liberty which they gave to their tongues, their vain-glorious Oſtentation of Religion, their exceſſive Pride, and their ambitious deſire of being accounted Saints, the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the precious People of the Lord, it ſeems to be a compleat mixture of Popery and Phanaticiſm, and however they pretend now to be aſhamed one of the other, and are at ſo much odds and variance that a large Kingdom is too little to contain them both, yet there was a time when they ſhook hands together, &amp; were both peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably united in one mans breaſt. Having thus taken a view of the falſe and Hypocritical Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees which ſhall in no caſe obtain an entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, let us in the next place conſider what manner of Righteouſneſs ours muſt be which will bring us to thoſe Manſions of Glory. And, 1. it muſt not have any of theſe Faults with which the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees was tainted, and rendred odious, and abominable in the ſight of God. Their Righteouſneſs (as ye have heard) was ſuch as conſiſted only in the performance of external Actions according to the literal Senſe of the Law, but ours muſt proceed further, even to the cleanſing and purifying our Hearts from all manner of evil thoughts. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> They, and they only ſhall enjoy that beatifical Viſion whoſe Heart is undefiled, for it is that which God chiefly reſpects; and ſo long as that is right and ſincere as to the Main, though we do ſometimes through the Frailty of our Nature
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107594:76"/>and the ſtrength of ſome Temptation that hath overcome us, fall into any ſin, yet we ſhall certainly obtain Pardon at the Hand of God upon our true Repentance. They thought themſelves well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if they did no evil; nay, more than ſo, if evil was done them by another Perſon, they thought they might with a ſafe Conſcience revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but our Maſter hath commanded us not to reſiſt Evil, but if any man ſmite us upon the Right cheek to turn to him the other alſo; and not only not to hurt our Neighbour, but to love our Enemies, to bleſs them that curſe us, to do good to them that hate us, and to pray for them which deſpitefully uſe us, and perſecute us. It is not ſufficient for us that our outward Actions are not Evil, but we muſt take heed to our Words and our Thoughts, we muſt make a Covenant with our Eyes, keep our Mouth with a bridle that we offend not in our Tongue, and bring into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt; for, for every idle Word and every miſguided Thought we ſhall give an account at the Day of Judgment. 2. Our Righteouſneſs muſt not be ſuch as makes us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that we can of our ſelves, and by our own ſtrength keep all the Commandments, and fulfill the whole Law. Alaſs, we are not able of our ſelves to keep any one Commandment; and S. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that <hi>if we offend in one point we are guilty of all.</hi> The Scripture hath moſt plainly and fully diſcovered to us, our weakneſs in this caſe; that we are ſo far from being able to perform any good Work, that we cannot of our ſelves ſo much as think a good Thought without the Holy Spirit of God inſpires it into our Hearts, who work in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107594:76"/>there is not a juſt man upon Earth that doth good, and ſins not, but that in many things we offend all, and that if we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us. Theſe, and the like expreſſions in Scripture, if we conſider them, are ſufficient to ſatisfie us that we are ſo far from being able to keep the whole Law, that we cannot perform any one Title of it as we ought: and therefore we muſt not as the Scribes and Phariſees, did place our Righteouſneſs in this, that we are able, and do perform an intire Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law. And if ſo, much leſs muſt we in the third place, as they did, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who follows their Example, doth at this day, boaſt of and Glory in our own works, as if they were meritorious in the ſight of God. The Scripture every where condemns this as the moſt dangerous and damnable Pride with which our Hearts can poſſibly be infected, and nothing will more certainly bar the Gate of Heaven againſt us, than our ſuppoſing that we can deſerve that it ſhould flie open unto us. <hi>How can a Man be juſt with God?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>In thy ſight,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, no man living ſhall be juſtified.</hi> And if no Man living can pretend to be juſt in the ſight of God ſo as to eſcape his Condemnation, ſurely, much leſs can any Man pretend to have done him ſo great ſervice as to merit a Reward from him. No, all boaſting and glorying on our part is utterly excluded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be glorying in our infirmities that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon us. We are taught a quite contrary Leſſon, a Leſſon of Meekneſs and Humility; when we have done our beſt, to ſay that we are unprofitable Servants, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the iniquity even of our moſt Holy things,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107594:77"/>and the ſhamefull Nakedneſs of our Righteouſneſs may be covered and hid from the pure Eyes of God, <hi>by the white and ſpotleſs Robe of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt.</hi> Fourthly, we muſt not as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees did, (and as too many that tread in their ſteps do at this day) place our Righteouſneſs in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to cenſure the Lives and Converſations of other Perſons, and in our backwardneſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into our own. Cenſoriouſneſs in ſome men's Opinion paſſes for a Goſpel-virtue, and he that is moſt forward to ſpeak evil of others, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of his betters, of his Superiours, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, is for ſo doing lookt upon to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saint. But ſurely, theſe are Saints of a new ſtamp; and I know no reaſon why they arrogate that Title to themſelves, except it be by an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis; becauſe they walk directly contrary to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which hath expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us not to judge, leſt we be judged our ſelves, and to ſpeak evil of no Man, eſpecially not to deſpiſe Dominion and ſpeak evil of Dignities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have an ambition to be of the number of thoſe mockers which S <hi>Jude</hi> propheſied ſhould come in the laſt time, who ſhould walk after their own ungodly Luſts, Separating themſelves, ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, having not the Spirit: all incomparable qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for Saint-ſhip! Fifthly, we muſt not, as the Phariſees did put on a ſhew of Religion pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to gain the Applauſe of Men, and to carry on our worldly Deſigns. I am ſure this unhappy Nation hath ſwarmed with Phariſees enough of this ſort; Men that with a ſpecious ſhew of Piety led captive ſilly Women, beguiled unſtable Souls, and gained Admiration of the credulous and eaſy Vulgar, that with ſanctified Pretentions, Holy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107594:77"/>Looks, frequent Faſtings, long Prayers, and canting and treaſonable Sermons, carried on the moſt villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and accurſed Deſigns, that ever publickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced Chriſtianity. And God grant that there be not too many ſuch Phariſees among us ſtill: but I paſs them by: <hi>their Names are odious, and their Religion ſcandalous. Laſtly we muſt not as</hi> the Phariſees did, and we know who doth Still, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr unwritten Traditions before the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God hath cauſed that ſacred Book to be written on purpoſe for our Inſtruction, and hath therein fully revealed ſo much of his Will to us, as is ſufficient for us to know in order to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining everlaſting Life: and we muſt not add to it, nor diminiſh from it, but acquieſce in it, and make it the ſole Rule and Meaſure of our Faith, impoſing nothing upon our own or other men's Conſciences, but what is manifeſtly conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous and agreeable to the Doctrine contained therein. Thus ye ſee that our Righteouſneſs muſt be thoroughly purged and cleanſed from all thoſe Defects with which the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees was defiled. But ſtill all this is not ſufficient: if our Righteouſneſs doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed theirs infinitely more than thus it will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth; we ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. That Righteouſneſs which muſt bring us thither muſt be abſolutely compleat and perfect, without Spot or Blemiſh ſuch as the All ſeeing Eye of God can diſcern no Defect in; and that it is impoſſible for us ever to find ſuch a Righteouſneſs as this in our ſelves I have already ſhewed you: and yet ſuch a Righteouſneſs we muſt all of us have, or elſe never expect Salvation, for <hi>without Holineſs,</hi> ay, and perfect Holineſs too,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107594:78"/>
                  <hi>no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Since therefore we our ſelves are not able to perform ſuch a Righteouſneſs as this, and yet ſuch an one is abſolutely neceſſary to bring us unto Heaven, we muſt ſeek it from ſome other perſon: and to whom ſhould we have recourſe for it, but to Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>who of God is made unto us Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> Let us therefore if we deſire to be ſaved, not truſt in our own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as the Phariſees did: <hi>for by the Works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified;</hi> but with the Hand of a true and lively Faith let us put on the Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs which will be ſure to hide our faults, and to preſent us holy, blameleſs, and undefiled in the Preſence of God. But let us not deceive our ſelves neither, and pretend to have this Faith, and conſequently that we have an intereſt in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, when there is no ſuch Matter; but let us try and examine our Faith whether it be a true and lively Faith or no. If it be not a Faith that Works by love; if it be not fruitful and productive of good Works, it is dead and inſignificant, it will ſtand us in no ſtead at all; but if we pretend ſo to lay hold on Chriſt, we ſhall only graſp a ſhadow. No, though we muſt not relie upon our own performances, yet we muſt work, ay, and work as heartily as if our Works were Meritorious too; but when we have done all we muſt utterly diſclaim our own Righteouſneſs, truſting only in the Merits of Chriſt, and deſiring with S. <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>we may be found in him, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> This is ſuch a Righteouſneſs as will never fail us; but whereas
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107594:78"/>the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees and of all other Hypocrites and Diſſemblers with God ſhall ſink them into the bottomleſs Pit, this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith will refreſh our Souls, and chear our Hearts with the ſweet Hopes and comfortable Expectation here, and bleſs them hereafter eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the joyfull Fruition of that Glory which God hath prepared for all them that love him.</p>

This, I ſay, is a Truth which all Chriſtians profeſs firmly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but yet alas how ſmall is the Number of thoſe that demonſtrate the Truth and Sincerity of their Faith, by their Holy Lives and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? We all of us know, and are aſſured, that there is a juſt God <hi>who will render to every man according to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.6. <hi>and will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34.7. We believe that there is an Heaven prepared for Saints, and an Hell for Sinners; and yet notwithſtanding this belief, how many thouſands that are called by the Name of Chriſt run on head-long, boldly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107594:79"/>in Wickedneſs, and purſue with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Eagerneſs and Delight, thoſe fatal Paths that lead to Deſtruction; as if the Joys of Heaven were a Trifle not worth our Acceptance, or the Torments of Hell the object rather of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires than Fears.

God tries all ways imaginable to reclaim us, and deliver us from the Jaws of Death. Sometimes he pours down his Judgments upon our Heads, that in our Affliction we may ſeek him early; and ſometimes he ſtretches forth the Arms of his Mercy to embrace us, and <hi>draws us to him with the Cords of a Man, with the Bands of Love,</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. Sometimes he holds forth the golden Scepter to us, and graciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to come and <hi>kiſs the Son leſt he be angry,</hi> and ſometimes he ſhakes his Rod of Iron over our Backs, and threatens to daſh us in pieces if we will not <hi>hear the Rod and who hath appointed it.</hi> Hence are thoſe many and gracious Invitations to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which God hath made to us in his Word, and thoſe terrible Threatnings which he hath
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107594:80"/>therein denounced to affright us from Sin: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all which there is ſcarce one to be found, that is more emphatical and piercing than this of my Text, which muſt needs fill the Hearts of all obſtinate and impenitent Sinners with Horrour; yea, and it ſtrikes a Terrour even into the Godly themſelves, and makes them <hi>work out their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling:</hi> It thunders Hell, certain and inevitable Damnation to the Wicked, and hardly admits the Righteous into Heaven: <hi>And if the Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly and the Sinner appear?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words are propounded by way of interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; a thing very frequent in Scripture, and generally uſed for the more powerful enforcing of ſome weighty and material Argument. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. that is, as much as if he had ſaid, I have ſpared for no care, nor pains, nor coſt, and could not poſſibly do any more in it than I did. So here in my Text, <hi>where ſhall the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly and the Sinner appear,</hi> intimates to us, that they ſhall not be able to appear at all, but ſhall be caſt for ever out of God's Preſence; when in the great and terrible Day of the Lord, <hi>they ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced,</hi> they ſhall be confounded with Horrour, and ſhall wonder and periſh. The words offer to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration theſe four things, two different ſorts of Perſons, the Righteous, and the Wicked; and the two different Ends of theſe Perſons, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Eſtates in the next World, Salvation of the one, and Damnation of the other: So that we may reſolve the Text into theſe two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. The Righteous ſhall be ſcarcely ſaved.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107594:80"/>2. The Wicked ſhall moſt certainly be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved.</hi> In ſpeaking to which Propoſition, I ſhall firſt ſhew you who are here meant by the Righteous: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I ſhall ſhew you why they are here ſaid to be ſcarcely ſaved. Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you who are here meant by the Righteous; and 'tis a far eaſier matter to deſcribe, than either to find out their Perſons, or to imitate their Example. For though Chriſtian Charity obliges to judge no Man raſhly, but to hope the beſt of all Men; yet in ſuch a Deluge of Profaneneſs and Impiety, as hath now overflowed the whole World, we may <hi>look for Judgment, but behold Oppreſſion; for Righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry,</hi> Iſa. 5.7. We may eaſily miſtake the Shadow for the Subſtance, and a Phariſaical Oſtentation of Righteouſneſs may impoſe upon the Charity of ſome Men, ſo far as to make them reverence a Hypocrite, and be ready to canonize a Perſon, whoſe Name God hath blotted out of the Book of Life. For if the All-ſeeing Eye of God, could diſcover but one juſt Perſon in ſo great a City as <hi>Sodom;</hi> nay, but one righteous Man <hi>(Noah)</hi> upon the Face of the whole Earth; ſurely we can expect to find but few righteous now, when we have great Reaſon to apprehend that the End of all things is at hand, and Sin abounds to ſuch a Degree, that it ſeems to have made the World as ripe now for the laſt Deluge of Fire, as it was of old for that of Water. And yet in the Midſt of this perverſe and crooked Generation, amongſt whom the Divine Providence hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us to ſojourn, it is hard to meet with any Man that doth not deſire to be accounted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107594:81"/>righteous, except ſome notorious and profligate Wretches that bid open Defiance to God and Goodneſs, and pride themſelves in being the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Heaven. For Virtue is ſo lovely and beautiful, that ſhe commands Reſpect and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence even from her profeſſed Enemies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts Applauſe out of the Mouth of Vice her ſelf. All Men commend her, but few embrace her: Many there are that <hi>render</hi> to her <hi>the calves of their lips,</hi> but few their heart. The Drunkard will preach Temperance over his full Cups. The Extortioner will magnifie Juſtice and Honeſty, and yet ſtill grind the Faces of the Poor. The ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Man will extol Humility; but he loves it in others, not in himſelf; and is never better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, than when he ſees his Brethren at his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, that he himſelf may be exalted. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Man will pretend as much as any one to Charity; but when any of Chriſt's afflicted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers naked, or hungry, or thirſty, or ſick, or impriſoned implores his help; he may perhaps, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, bid them <hi>depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled,</hi> and that is all the Charity that he will afford them. The common Swearer will exclaim ſometimes againſt Profaneneſs, and be ready to ask God pardon almoſt after every Oath, and ſwear again with the next Breath. The wanton, if he light into ſevere and grave Company, will ſometimes pretend to abhor his darling Sin, and preach a Lecture of Chaſtity, when perhaps he hath made an aſſignation the very next Hour to meet his Minion. Thus is Holineſs and Piety ſo excellent in its own Nature, ſo deſirable a Perfection, that almoſt all Men praiſe it, but few practiſe it. Every Man, though
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107594:81"/>he loves the Wages of Unrighteouſneſs, is ready to wiſh with <hi>Balaam,</hi> that he may die the Death of the Righteous, but how few are there that are careful to live his life. Certainly ſuch Perſons as theſe are not the Righteous that are here meant in my Text, who ſhall be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>through much Tribulation, to enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> but they are notorious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, whoſe <hi>hope ſhall periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed further, there are another ſort of Men in the World, whoſe Righteouſneſs, though it exceeds that of the Scribes and Phariſees, yet if it be weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, it will be found too light. And though it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Memory to Poſterity and raiſe a laſting Name for them here upon Earth, yet it will never be able to write one for them in the Book of Life. I mean Men who in general are of honeſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Converſation, who endeavour to frame and order their lives ſo according to God's word, that no Man can find any juſt reaſon to queſtion their Title to Salvation: but nevertheleſs they have ſome beloved ſin or other known perhaps to none but God and themſelves, which will hinder their flight towards Heaven: and though the Pleaſure they take in it, makes them willing to think it but a little one, it will at the laſt prove ſo big as to hinder their entrance at the ſtrait Gate. But come what will on't, they can by no means be perſwaded to part with it; but they hope God will bear with them in this one thing; as <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaid to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 5.18. <hi>When I bow down my ſelf in the Houſe of</hi> Rimmon, <hi>the Lord pardon thy Servant in this thing.</hi> They can wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conform to God's Pleaſure in other things,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107594:82"/>and contentedly endeavour to keep all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments but this one; tho', as S. <hi>James</hi> aſſures us, by oſſending but in one point they are guilty of all: by indulging themſelves in the wilful breach of any one of God's Commandments, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the whole Law, and utterly exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all hopes of Salvation. Such an one was the rich young Man, Matth. 19. that came to enquire of our Saviour <hi>what good thing he muſt do to have eternal Life.</hi> No doubt he was to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of an unblameable Converſation, and of good Repute in the place where he lived; and Jeſus himſelf began to love him, when he heard him give ſo good an account of himſelf, and found him deſirous to be ſtill further inſtructed in his duty. But little did the young Man expect ſo ſevere a Command as to <hi>ſell all his Poſſeſſions, and to take up the Croſs and follow</hi> Chriſt. This was ſore againſt the hair. It was an hard thing, he thought to ſell his Poſſeſſions to take up a Croſs; an hard thing to part with his Wealth to purchaſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to exchange a Garland of Roſes for a Crown of Thorns. If Salvation muſt coſt ſo much, he was reſolved to let it alone, and thought it not worth his while to part with his preſent Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Reverſion of Heaven: but though he had made ſo great a ſhew of Religion, and had kept (as he pretended) all the Commandments from his Youth, yet Chriſts Yoke was too heavy for him; and <hi>he went away ſorrowing, for he had great Poſſeſſions.</hi> This is, no doubt, the caſe of many now in the world that paſs in the Eyes of Men for good Chriſtians. They make a very fair ſhew of Religion, inſomuch that they cheat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their own ſelves, and perſwade themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107594:82"/>a groundleſs preſumption of their own Salvation, and that the condition of their Souls is very good when it muſt of neceſſity be otherwiſe, ſo long as they harbour a Serpent in their boſom which will be ſure to ſting them to death, ſome beloved ſin or other of which they cannot find in their Hearts to repent. Perhaps they come to Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and for the moſt part receive the word with gladneſs. But nevertheleſs, <hi>their goodneſs is but as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</hi> Though ſometimes at the hearing of a ſearching Sermon, their affections may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily moved for the preſent; yet the good ſeed of the word can take no firm Root in ſuch ſtony Ground. It is but only a ſudden Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they feel in their Hearts, which paſſes away as quick as it came. It is but a faint repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, an empty ſhadow of that unſpeakable comfort and joy in the Holy Ghoſt which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaſt to the Godly, a Heaven upon Earth to all thoſe happy Souls, <hi>who are ſealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi> Theſe Men, like <hi>Agrippa,</hi> are but almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians. Some good thing there is in the them toward the Lord; but it is ſo very little, that their faith is leſs than a grain of Muſtard-ſeed. They would fain enter into Heaven at the laſt; but neither the hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor fear of Hell can prevail with them, to <hi>lay aſide</hi> that darling <hi>Sin which doth ſo eaſily beſet them.</hi> They can be content to let God have a good ſhare of their Heart; but they cannot be perſwaded to give him the whole. They can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear God's Word preached, and perhaps, for the moſt part they delight in it too. They love to hear Sin condemned, and Godlineſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107594:83"/>ſo long as they imagine themſelves to be unconcerned. But if the Preacher chance to touch one of theſe Men to the quick, and ſaith to him in plain Terms, <hi>Thou art the Man;</hi> then he is more ready to fly in his Face like <hi>Ahab,</hi> and to tell him, that he is a <hi>Troubler of Iſrael,</hi> than to confeſs with <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>he hath ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> Or at the beſt he goes away ſorrowing like the Rich-man, or trembling like <hi>Felix,</hi> and deſires to hear no more of thoſe matters till the Archangel's Trump ſhall ſummon him to hear of them, to his Everlaſting Confuſion. Whilſt the Prophet ſpeaks to theſe Men ſmooth things, ſo long they can hear him with pleaſure, and he is to them, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to the Jews, <hi>as a very lovely Song of one that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well on an Inſtrument.</hi> But if he ſharply rebukes Sin, and they find their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces touched to the quick, then they are pricked to the Heart, not with godly Sorrow and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, but with Fury and Indignation. While he ſpeaks to them in the ſtill ſmall Voice of the Goſpel, and preaches the glad Tidings of Peace and Reconciliation with God by Jeſus Chriſt, they are pleaſed at the Heart, and are too ready to lay hold on thoſe Promiſes which belong only to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. But if he thunder out againſt them the Curſes of the Law, and denounces the Wrath of God againſt all impenitent Sinners; then they ſit but at little eaſe in their Seats, and the Church begins to be too hot for them. They like it well, ſo long as the Spiritual Chirurgeon pours Balm into their Wounds; but if he takes his Probe and begins to ſearch them, they are not able to endure it. The Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> had
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107594:83"/>never been condemned to be <hi>fed with Bread of Affliction, and Water of Affliction,</hi> had he been one of the lying Prophets, and propheſied good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ahab.</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's Head might have remained ſecure on his Shoulders, and never have been ſerved up in a Charger, to ſatisfie the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a revengeful Woman, had he but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Herod</hi> quietly to enjoy his beloved <hi>Herodias.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour had never been Crucified, had he not ſo frequently and publickly reproved the Hypocriſie of the Scribes and Phariſees. Thus ye ſee the Righteouſneſs of theſe partial Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Piety, and how dangerous a thing it is for Men to take the liberty to cheriſh any one Sin. For though at the preſent it may ſeem to be but a little one, it will one Day ſhew it ſelf more at large, appear in its proper Colours, and like the <hi>little Cloud that aroſe out of the Sea like a Man's hand,</hi> it will ſuddenly overſpread their whole Heaven, and darken their Conſciences with Horrour and Aſtoniſhment. They may paſs for good Chriſtians in fair Weather; but what will they do in foul? They may venture abroad, and ſhew their Heads boldly while the Sun ſhines; but can they out-face a Storm? They appear like Saints in the Halcyon Days of the Church, when ſhe enjoys Peace and Tranquillity, and flouriſhes under the Protection of pious and prudent Governours; but ſurely they will trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the fiery Trial, and make Shipwreck con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith in the Tempeſt of Perſecution? They may bleſs God when they are in Proſperity, while he <hi>makes an Hedge about them and their Houſe;</hi> but can they do it as heartily (like <hi>Job</hi>) when they are in Affliction? A <hi>Judas</hi> may own
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107594:84"/>Chriſt, and cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> when he rides in Triumph towards <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and a <hi>Peter</hi> may deny him when he is at <hi>Calvary.</hi> 'Tis Perſecution that is the ſureſt Touch-ſtone to try a Chriſtian: 'Tis that which will diſcover the true Metal from the counterfeit. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he that will readily lay down his Life for Chriſt's ſake, will much more be willing to part with all his Sins for him, and will not dare to harbour the leaſt Luſt which may provoke his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. But ſuppoſe there ariſes no ſuch thing as Perſecution to diſturb them, but all be calm and quiet, ſuch Perſons as theſe muſt needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unhappy notwithſtanding. For ſurely, they will find but very little Satisfaction in any of their Actions, no not in their very Prayers themſelves; <hi>For we know that God hears not Sinners;</hi> and he is a Sinner (though not ſo great a one) that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly allows himſelf in the Commiſſion of any one known Sin, as well as he that <hi>ſells himſelf to do evil in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> and commits all Iniquity with greedineſs. <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt fall before their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſo long as there is an accurſed thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and ſo long as we allow our ſelves in the Commiſſion of any one Sin, our very Prayers themſelves will be turned into Sin. And now, if <hi>it will profit a Man nothing though he gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul,</hi> what a Madneſs then are they guilty of, who being otherwiſe well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to all the Duties of Religion, forfeit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Satisfaction of but one predominant Luſt? This is like <hi>Eſau</hi> to ſell their Birth-right for a Meſs of Pottage; like our firſt Parents, to loſe the whole Garden by the eating of but one forbidden Tree. Methinks, when they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107594:84"/>thus far, when they are advanced ſo near to the Gate of Heaven, they might take one ſtep more, and enter in. When they have mortified all their Luſts but one, what a ſhamefull thing is it to yield to that at the laſt; and how diſmal will their Fall be, who ſhall be caſt down to Hell from ſo fair a Proſpect of Salvation?</p>
               <p>But to leave theſe there are another ſort of Men, who though they have attained to an higher degree of Righteouſneſs than this, yet are not the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous which are here meant in my Text. For there are Some Men of ſo unprejudiced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed Underſtanding, ſo quick ſighted, that they can diſcover ſuch a ſplendour and beauty in Virtue, and ſuch an abominable Filthineſs and Deformity in Vice, that the former is ſweeter to them than their Life, and death it ſelf leſs dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the latter. Neither Art, nor Force, neither Flatteries, nor Threats can divorce them from that ſweet content and joy, which is the natural effect and conſequence of a Virtuous Life, or perſwade them to ingulf themſelves in that deplorable Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which torments thoſe Souls that are enſlaved to Vice, but they conſtantly do their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as the Apoſtle exhorts, to <hi>abſtain from all appearance of evil.</hi> They ſee that the laughter of thoſe <hi>fools,</hi> who combine together to <hi>make a mock at Sin,</hi> proceeds only from the teeth outward, and is but <hi>like the crackling of thorns under a pot.</hi> They ſee all that Madneſs that reigns and rages in the World, and they find that there is no true Comfort and Satisfaction to be had in any thing, but Virtue alone; and therefore to that they ſtedfaſtly cleave, with a reſolution to part with their lives and fortunes, and whatſoever elſe is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107594:85"/>deareſt to them, rather than to violate any of its Laws. But notwithſtanding all this, though I muſt needs confeſs that ſuch perſons as theſe are burning and ſhining Lights in the World, yet if they have not one qualification more to make them perfect, they are not the Righteous here meant in my Text. For ſuch perſons, as Hiſtorians tell us, were <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> and many more of the ancient Heathens who never heard of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus, <hi>the only Name under Heaven given among Men whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far I have given you only a negative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Righteous Man, and ſhewed you what Manner of Perſons, that make a fair ſhew in the World, have nevertheleſs no juſt right to that Title. And now to declare to you poſitively who he is, and to ſhew you the difference of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man here meant in my Text, from the three former ſorts of Men which I have been deſcribing, I muſt tell you, that he hath nothing at all in him of the firſt ſort (for it is impoſſible that ye ſhould imagin him to be a notorious Hypocrite) and he hath all in him that is good in either of the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to all this he adds the laſt, and beſt qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is Faith in Chriſt. It is Faith alone by which he lives; it is Faith alone which renders him truly Righteous, and juſtifies him in the ſight of God. And here I mean not a falſe and dead Faith, which indeed is no Faith at all; but a true and lively one that brings forth Fruits meet for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch a Faith as will be ſure to ſhew it ſelf in him by the Holineſs of his Life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>his works praiſe him in the gates.</hi> All thoſe excellent Virtues which have commended the Names of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and other renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107594:85"/>Heathens to poſterity, are in him; but in a more eminent Manner Sublimated and refined by Grace, and made acceptable to God by Faith, <hi>without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe him. Cato</hi> might love his friends; but he loves his Enemies. <hi>Cato</hi> might do good to them that did good to him, but he <hi>doth good to them that hate him, bleſſes them that curſe him, and Prays for them which deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe him and perſecute him. Cato</hi>'s heroick Spirit might (one would have thought) patiently have endured Tribulation; but his unhappy End plainly ſhews that he fainted under it: but <hi>Job</hi> doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patiently bear all that heavy chain of afflictions with which he was tried, but he bleſſes God in the midſt of them all as heartily as ever he did in the height of his proſperity: as well in his Sickneſs as in his health; as well when God takes away from him all that he had as when he cauſed <hi>his candle to ſhine upon his head,</hi> and made him <hi>the greateſt of all the Men of the Eaſt. Cato</hi> might prefer Death before Vice, and chuſe rather to endure the moſt exquiſite torments, than to commit a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed action; but the Righteous Man doth not only willingly lay down his Life for the truth whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is called to it, but he <hi>rejoyces that he is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the Name of Jeſus.</hi> In a word that love of Virtue which was in <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe excellent Worthies which we read of amongſt the Heathen, though it hath procured them a <hi>Name</hi> which is far <hi>better than precious oyntment,</hi> and will ſhine in Hiſtory as long as the World ſhall laſt, to the ſhame of all Chriſtians that come ſhort of their perfections, yet it is probable that it proceeded chiefly from ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; either from ſome hopes and expectation they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107594:86"/>had of a reward in another Life, or elſe from that Peace and Tranquility of mind which they found that it procured them in this: but the Righteous Man aims chiefly at the Honour of God. All his actions, as near as he can, he deſigns primarily and principally to advance the Glory of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and his own Salvation poſſeſſes but the ſecond place in his thoughts. As S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, <hi>Whether he eats or drinks, or whatſoever he doth in word or deed, he doth all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and to the Glory of God.</hi> And after he hath <hi>paſſed the time of his Sojourning here in fear;</hi> when he hath <hi>fought the good fight, finiſhed his courſe, kept the Faith,</hi> overcome all his Spiritual Enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the temptations of Satan, ſubdued and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his own Luſts and Corruptions, deſpiſed the Deriſion of thoſe Fools that ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornful; trampled upon all the vain pomps and flattering Glories of this preſent World, and after all this perhaps at the laſt is called to ſuffer an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and painful Death for the teſtimony of a good conſcience and to endure the cruelleſt torments that the wit and malice of wicked Men can inflict upon him; then he takes up his Croſs with joy, goes like a Lamb to the Slaughter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that he hath done nothing, that he is but <hi>an unprofitable Servant,</hi> that he is leſs than the leaſt of all God's Mercies, and that his Life is a Sacrifice unworthy of his acceptance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſires to appear before God's Tribunal <hi>not having his own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> This is ſuch a Righteous Man as is here meant in my Text, This is that <hi>Bleſſed Man unto whom the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107594:86"/>not iniquity, and in whoſe Spirit there is no guile.</hi> And this is that Man who (as it is plain from my Text) ſhall <hi>Scarcely be ſaved.</hi> How that comes to paſs I ſhall hereafter endeavour to ſhew you. For though he ſhall be <hi>Scarcely ſaved,</hi> yet ſaved he ſhall be infallibly; for to him that is <hi>faithful unto Death Chriſt will give a Crown of Life.</hi>

               <p>IN the handling of theſe words I have already ſhewed you, who the Righteous Man is, and how he is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World. He is a Man of a Temper and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation exceedingly different from the generality of Mankind, and lives amongſt them like a Stranger, and a Sojourner in a foreign Countrey, where he hath few or no Acquaintance; like a ſingle Stalk of good Corn in a large Field of Tares. Few Men mind him, few regard him, few keep him company, few delight in his Converſation, and fewer imitate it: He is a Proverb, and a By-word among the Ungodly, <hi>who account his Life madneſs, and his End to be without Honour. For Chriſt's ſake he bears Reproach: They that ſit in the Gate ſpeak againſt him; and he is the Song of the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards.</hi> The World and he are irreconcilable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as contrary one to the other, as Light and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107594:87"/>Darkneſs, as Heaven and Hell, as Chriſt and Belial, while the Wicked and Ungodly rejoice, he mourns; while they laugh, he weeps; while they triumph in the very <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bonds of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> he is a <hi>Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> while they <hi>are in great Power, and ſpread themſelves like a green Bay tree, lie upon Beds of Ivory, and ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Couches, and eat the Lambs out of the Flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the Stall,</hi> live in Idleneſs, and Luxury, and Pleaſure, <hi>nouriſhing their Hearts as in a day of ſlaughter,</hi> and pampering up thoſe Luſts, which of themſelves are too apt to rebel, <hi>he keeps under his Body and brings it into ſubjection, crucifies the old Man, that the Body of Sin may be deſtroyed,</hi> ſubdues and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies his Corruptions by Prayer and Faſting, and <hi>walks mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> He meets with ſcarce any thing in this ſinful World, which can delight his Soul; but almoſt every Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle that he beholds is to him an occaſion of ſorrow. He grieves for his own Sins, and he grieves for thoſe of other Men, whom he ſees with ſo much Eagerneſs and Jollity poſting towards the Gates of Death: He <hi>grieves for the Afflictions of Joſeph,</hi> and laments to ſee the Church of God in Adverſity. Nothing contents him, nothing pleaſes him in this Valley of Tears, but that he is pleaſed at nothing here below; but <hi>his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſet on thoſe things which are above,</hi> and the earneſt Deſire of his Heart is to <hi>depart, and to be with Chriſt:</hi> Which happy End he ſhall at the laſt moſt certainly attain to, though it ſhall not be without great Pains and Difficulty, and as my Text expreſſes it, <hi>ſcarcely.</hi> And ſo I proceed to make good my ſecond Undertaking, which was
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107594:88"/>
               </p>
               <p>To ſhew you why St. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſuppoſes the Righteous to be <hi>ſcarcely ſaved.</hi> Which word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not an Impoſſibility that they ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (for certainly <hi>then of all Men they would be moſt miſerable</hi>) nor a Poſſibility that any one of them ſhould not be ſaved: For every one of them is as ſure to obtain Salvation, as he is ſure to obtain it <hi>ſcarcely. Thoſe that thou gaveſt me,</hi> ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the Son of Perdition,</hi> who never was one of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Righteous. But this word <hi>ſcarcely</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes only the many and great Difficulties, and Troubles, and Dangers, through which the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are to paſs in their way to Heaven. They muſt be tempted, afflicted, ſcorned, derided, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; They muſt labour, they muſt ſweat, they muſt die, that they may be ſaved, and paſs by the very Gates of Hell in their way to Paradiſe. There are large Manſions, and a Glorious, and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom prepared for them; but they have many potent and malicious Enemies, all which they muſt overcome before they can take poſſeſſion of it. There is a Crown of Glory laid up for them; but they muſt run for it if they will obtain it. They muſt wage War with Devils, and <hi>wreſtle againſt Principalities and Powers,</hi> before they can be accounted worthy to be Companions for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And now if <hi>David</hi> that repoſed ſo great a Confidence in his God, and was ſufficiently aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he was ordained to be King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did nevertheleſs begin to deſpond, and was ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that he ſhould <hi>one Day periſh by the Hand of Saul,</hi> much more may the Righteous fear and tremble, who have far greater and mightier Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies than <hi>Saul,</hi> to oppoſe them, able to diſmay
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107594:88"/>the ſtouteſt Souldier in the Camp of Chriſt, had he not a Shield of Faith to defend him from their Weapons, and an Eye of Faith to diſcover, that thoſe that are for him are more than thoſe that are againſt him. When a mighty Hoſt of the <hi>Syrians</hi> beſieged <hi>Eliſha,</hi> God placed <hi>Horſes and Chariots of Fire round about him</hi> for his Defence. So though the Righteous Man hath Devils for his Enemies, yet he hath Angels for his Guardians, and Jeſus Chriſt the Captain of his Salvation. He may march on then with Confidence and Aſſurance of the Victory; but he muſt fight, if he will obtain it. Heaven is his Inheritance, <hi>the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him from the Foundation of the World;</hi> but he is a Stranger and a Pilgrim here in a far Countrey, and his Journey to it is long and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome: He hath a narrow and rugged way to walk in, tedious and irkſome to Fleſh and Blood, and the Gate that muſt admit him into thoſe Manſions of Glory, is exceeding ſtrait, and he muſt ſtrive hard, if he will enter in at it. Thus ye ſee in general, that the Righteous ſhall <hi>ſcarcely be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> that is, it ſhall coſt him much Labour, and Sweat, and Pains, to work out his Salvation; and through much Tribulation, through many and great Troubles and Afflictions, through many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Difficulties and affrighting Dangers, he ſhall at the laſt enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and receive a Crown of Glory. And this will appear more plainly, if we conſider diſtinctly theſe ſeveral Difficulties which he hath to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>And theſe are, Firſt, his own natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The beſt and holieſt of Men (our Bleſſed Saviour only excepted) who was ſanctified from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107594:89"/>the Womb) are all conceived and born in Sin. <hi>By one Man,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. And this Original Sin (as it is generally ſtiled by Divines) which the Righteous themſelves (even the beſt of God's Saints, as well as other Men) bring into the World with them, deriving it from <hi>Adam</hi> by a wonderful, but certain, Propagation, is of a ſpreading and infectious Nature, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deadly to the Soul (if it be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubdued and mortified) as Leproſie to the Body. It is ever active and ſtirring, labouring and ſtruggling continually to get the Maſtery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Soul, that ſo it may break out into open and actual Tranſgreſſions: And too often it doth ſo even in good Men, and prevails ſometimes over the moſt pious and devouteſt Chriſtians. This was that which moved <hi>David</hi> to commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Murder. This was that which ſhook the Conſtancy of <hi>Peter,</hi> and made him ſo timorouſly and baſely to deny his Maſter. And this is that which cauſes ſo many Weakneſſes, and Failings in all the Saints of God; ſo that <hi>there is not a juſt Man upon Earth that doth good, and ſins not;</hi> but in every Man there <hi>is a Law in his Members, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Law of his Mind, and bringing him into Captivity to the Law of Sin which is in his Members,</hi> Rom. 7.23. In every Man, as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Fleſh luſts againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh: and theſe two are contrary the one to the other;</hi> ſo that, by means of this inteſtine War within him, it comes to paſs often times, <hi>that he cannot do the things that he would.</hi> Even the Heathen
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107594:89"/>Philoſophers did obſerve and complain of (though they knew not the Cauſe of) this ſtrange Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of humane Nature. <hi>Plato</hi> tells us, that Men are by Nature wicked, and cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to do that which is right; and that the two great and principal Diſeaſes of the Soul are Ignorance and Vice. And to the ſame Effect <hi>Tully</hi> obſerves, that Nature is to Man a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, that brings him into the World with a naked Body, feeble and helpleſs, and with a Soul throughout the whole Courſe of his Life, ſorrowful and diſtracted with Multiplicity of Cares and Troubles, tormented with Fears, tired with Labour, and prone to Luſt, wherein the Divine Light, Wit, and good Manners are as it were overwhelmed and ſtifled. This ſad Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all Mankind is in by Nature, I ſay, the wiſer Sort even amongſt the Heathen, amidſt the groſs Darkneſs of Paganiſm and Idolatry had ſome little Knowledge of, though they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of the true Cauſe and Reaſon of it. And therefore they made it their chief Care and Buſineſs, by their Learning and Philoſophy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of their Power to correct and amend it. But unto us Chriſtians God hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked this Secret, and hath fully diſcovered this great and hidden Myſtery, which all the Learning of the profoundeſt Heathen Philoſophers was not able to ſearch out. In the lively Oracles of the Holy Scriptures he hath fully explained unto us both the Cauſe, and Danger, and Remedy of this Corruption of our Nature. In that Sacred Book we have it repreſented to us under divers Names and Characters, all of them foul and abominable like it ſelf. This is that which (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17.)
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107594:90"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the Sin that dwells in us:</hi> Becauſe ſince the Fall of our Firſt Parents it is become natural and hereditary to us, and never leaves us nor forſakes us in this World, but abides conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in our Fleſh, even unto Death; whence in the ſame Chapter it is called, <hi>the Evil that is preſent with us,</hi> and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.1. <hi>the Sin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us;</hi> becauſe it cleaves to us ſo cloſely, and inſeparably, and with ſo much Force and Violence, preſſes and beſieges all the Strength and Powers of our Soul. The word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is very Elegant and Emphatical, and but once uſed in all the New Teſtament, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Sin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us;</hi> that Sin which doth as it were hug and embrace us, and is continually inſinuating and winding it ſelf like a Serpent into our Hearts, with a Deſign to deceive and beguile us. This is that which (<hi>ver.</hi> 15. of the ſame Chapter) is called <hi>a Root of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs ſpringing up to trouble us;</hi> becauſe it is ever plentiful in producing evil Branches, and corrupt and deadly Fruit. This is that which by St. <hi>James</hi> is called, <hi>the Luſts that war in our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> James 4.1 and by St. <hi>Peter, the fleſhly Luſts which war againſt the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>the old Man,</hi> and <hi>the Body of Sin,</hi> Rom. 6 6. And what the Members of that Body are, he tells us, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Fornication, Uncleanneſs, inordinate Affection, evil Concupiſcence, and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry?</hi> Thus ye ſee the firſt Difficulty that the Righteous Man hath to encounter within his way to Heaven, which renders that way ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to him, that notwithſtanding all his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution, he cannot walk in it without great Pains and Labour. He carries a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107594:90"/>and heavy Clog about him, from which he cannot poſſibly diſengage himſelf, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pulls him back, and hinders and retards his Soul in its Flight towards thoſe glorious Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Joy and Happineſs, towards which it doth ſo eagerly preſs forward. And had he no other Enemies but this one to vanquiſh, even this alone might be ſufficient to ſatisfie us, that he ſhall <hi>ſcarcely be ſaved;</hi> ſince it is moſt certain that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be ſaved at all, except he do overcome this firſt Enemy of his Salvation, which of all others is the moſt formidable. One deceitful <hi>Dalilab</hi> was worſe to <hi>Samſon,</hi> than all the Philiſtines: and this one innate, inteſtine Foe of ours, which lies continually in our Boſom, is more dangerous to us than either the World or the Devil, both which join their Forces together, with this, to bring us to Deſtruction: And could we (as we have all ſolemnly promiſed, and engaged to do in our Baptiſmal Vow,) renounce all the ſinfull Luſts of the Fleſh, we might eaſily renounce alſo the Devil, and all his Works, and the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World.</p>
               <p>But ſtill to render the Righteous Man's Task harder, and his way to Heaven more rugged and difficult, he hath beſides this Enemy within him (his own original Corruptions) two Enemies more without to engage with, the World, and the Devil. Firſt, The World, which with all its Pomps and Vanities, its gilded Baits, and deceitful Entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments allures and invites him to ſet his Heart and Affections wholly upon theſe worthleſs Toyes and Trifles here below. With all the ſpecious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Pleaſure, Riches, Honour, and what not? It ſeeks to alienate and eſtrange his Thoughts from
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107594:91"/>God, from his native Country, from the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> that <hi>Jeruſalem, which is above, the Mother of us all;</hi> and to perſwade him to ſet up his ſtaff here in this Vale of Tears, where he is but a ſtranger and a Pilgrim; and, like the Children of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> to content himſelf with an inheritance on this ſide <hi>Jordan;</hi> for the Tranſitory and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enjoyments of this preſent Life, to exclude himſelf out of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to loſe the eternal Glory and Happyneſs of the Saints in light. This World is a Shop, an inexhauſtible Magazine of Temptations ſuitable and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Conſtitution and deſires of all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> Here then the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, the conſtant and faithful Souldier and Champion of Jeſus Chriſt, is again, fiercely aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his way to Heaven by this ſecond Adverſary the World Here he meets with every thing that can gratifie the moſt carnal and ſenſual Appetite. Which way ſoever he ſtands moſt inclined (and ſome way or other that natural Corruption, wherein all Men are conceived and born, will be apt more or leſs, to ſway him) he ſhall be ſure to have a Bait fitted to his Humour. Whatſoever it be that is moſt likely to ſeduce, and intice him into the Snares of Sin, the World is amply ſtored with all things, and is ever ready to furniſh him: ſo that it highly concerns him to ſtand continually upon his guard praying always that God would <hi>turn away his Eyes from beholding Vanity, and quicken him in his way;</hi> that he may ſo paſs through things Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, that he finally loſe not the things Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>But further yet; beſides theſe two Enemies of his Salvation, his own fleſh, and the World he hath
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107594:91"/>ſtill another that is indefatigable in plotting, and contriving his Deſtruction; and that is the Devil, whoſe buſineſs it is continually <hi>like a roaring Lion to walk to and fro in the earth ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> This is the great and chief Enemy of Mankind, to whoſe accurſed deſigns the other two are fatally helpful, and ſubſervient. It was he that beguiled our firſt Parents in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and by that Means plunged both them, and all their poſterity into a ſtate of Sin, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And now he makes uſe of that advantage he hath gained over us: he joyns againſt us, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our luſts; and when they ſeek to draw us away to any thing that is evil, he is ever ready to back and ſtrengthen their Temptations with his own <hi>ſecret whiſpers, and ſuggeſtions. When the World offers any thing to us that is pleaſant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting,</hi> he is ready to ſet a freſh gloſs upon it, that may render its Charms more prevalent. He leaves no Stone unturned, no project, nor Deſign unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, by which he may bring us into the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Slavery of Sin. His Power is great, his Induſtry unwearied and his Malice implacable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Sons of Men: and by how much the more vigilant and careful, the Perſon againſt whom he bends his Force, is to ſtand upon his Guard, and to defend himſelf againſt his Aſſaults and Stratagems, ſo much the fiercer are his On-fets ſo much the more violent and outragious is his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So that above all others the Righteous Man, that conſtantly withſtands and reſiſts his Wiles hath the hardeſt Task to perform. Other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that eaſily yield to his Temptations, he may ſafely leave to themſelves. He knows that they have an Enemy within them, that will be ſure to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107594:92"/>be their Ruin; that their own Luſts will be ſufficient to prevail againſt them; and that they themſelves, without his help, will work out their own Damnation. But where he meets with Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there he doubles his Diligence, and uſes all the Means that Power, or Policy, or Malice can ſuggeſt to him in order to the effecting of his Deſigns. No ſooner hath the Man of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one Temptation, but he preſently ſets upon him with another: No ſooner hath <hi>the Shield of Faith quenched</hi> one of his <hi>fiery Darts,</hi> but it is again aſſaulted with a ſecond. We read, that he dealt thus with our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf. Three ſeveral Attempts he made upon him and would not leave him, until he found that he was indeed the Son of God, and that it was utterly in vain for him to hope to prevail againſt him by any of his Temptations. And ſurely, if he had ſo much impudence as not to leave Chriſt our Head before the third Aſſault, he will much more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer <hi>a repulſe from any of his Members. Thus ye ſee how great oppoſition the Righteous Man is ſure to meet with,</hi> and with what cruel and dangerous Enemies he is daily to fight, during the time of his Sojourning here upon Earth. And by this Means it comes to paſs that he is <hi>ſcarcely ſaved;</hi> ſo <hi>ſcarcely,</hi> that if the inceſſant importunities of his own corruptions, the ſweet and alluring Baits and Temptations of the World; and all the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Malice, and Power, and Policy of Hell could prevail againſt him, he ſhould certainly be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. All theſe Adverſaries muſt be ſubdued by him, before he can be eſteemed worthy through the merits of Chriſt, <hi>to receive a crown of</hi> Life. Yea, and beſides all this, I might proceed further
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107594:92"/>and ſhew you that as to outward Appearance, and in the Opinion of Men, even God himſelf, ſometimes ſeems to be his Enemy here in this World; foraſmuch as he often laies upon him heavy and great Afflictions for the Trial of his Patience and Faith. His Portion in this Life is, Sorrow, Perſecution, taking up the Croſs and ſuffering for Righteouſneſs ſake. All theſe things are entailed upon every true Diſciple of Chriſt, and he muſt expect to have his ſhare, more or leſs, of every one of them <hi>While the wicked are in great Power, and ſpread themſelves like a green Bay-tree,</hi> while they enjoy the world at will, and live in Eaſe and Plenty and Proſperity, the Righteous <hi>are killed all the day long, and accounted as ſheep for the Slaughter.</hi> This was our bleſſed Saviour's own Condition here upon Earth. All his whole Life was but one continued ſcene of ſufferings; and even from his Mother's Womb to his Death he was all along <hi>a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</hi> When he firſt came into the World, he came in a very Mean, and deſpicable Condition, ſo poorly provided for, that he had not ſo much as a Houſe wherein he might <hi>lay his Head,</hi> nor a cradle wherein he might reſt; but was forced to be content with a Stable for the one, and a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the other. And all the reſt of his Life was anſwerable to this Mean beginning. He was continually affronted, and abuſed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by the Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and by almoſt all Men, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed: and after all this he was moſt perfidiouſly betrayed by one of his own Diſciples, denied by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of them, and forſaken by all the reſt and at the laſt moſt barbarouſly murdered by bloudy
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107594:93"/>and ſinful Men. And if God dealt thus hardly with his only begotten Son <hi>in whom he was ever well-pleaſed,</hi> it would be unreaſonable for his Diſciples and Followers to expect to fare ſo much better than their Lord, as to be wholly exempted from Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this Life. If the Captain of our Salvation was not made perfect but through ſufferings; ſurely, then we ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, except we drink more or leſs of the ſame Cup. This our bleſſed Lord hath aſſured us ſhall be the Portion of all that will follow him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 27. <hi>If any Man come to me and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. And whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs and come after me, cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> And <hi>In the World ye ſhall have Tribulation,</hi> John 16.33. And this the holy Apoſtles afterwards found true by their own Experience. They were all hated, and maligned, and perſecuted whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they went, and not one of them died a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death, but S. <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple whom our Saviour ſeemed to love above the reſt, and perhaps was therefore pleaſed to exempt him from ſuffering a violent Death, as the other did. And thus it fared afterwards with their Succeſſours the Biſhops and Paſtours of the primitive Church: yea and not only with them, but with the greateſt part of their Flock too. Every one that was known to profeſs the Faith of Chriſt was perſecuted as a Traytour; and to be a Chriſtian was to be a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Offender. And though at preſent by the bleſſing of God, the Light of the Goſpel ſhines amongſt us gloriouſly; yet even amongſt Chriſtians themſelves thoſe few rare Examples of Piety, thoſe Perſons
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107594:93"/>that are extraordinarily ſtrict, and careful, to live anſwerable to their Profeſſion, <hi>in all Holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and Godlineſs,</hi> are generally hated, and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and looked upon with an evil Eye, and ſuffer more Sorrow and Affliction in the World than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men. And now I have given you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all thoſe dangerous Enemies, and thoſe manifold and great Difficulties and Troubles, which the Righteous Man hath to overcome in his way to Heaven. And from what I have ſaid, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident, that he ſhall <hi>ſcarcely be ſaved:</hi> that is, it ſhall coſt him great pains, and ſtriving to <hi>work out his Salvation,</hi> and <hi>through much Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the Righteous be thus <hi>ſcarcely ſaved;</hi> I need not inſiſt much upon the other Propoſition, nor ſpend many words to ſhew you that the wicked <hi>the ungodly and the ſinner</hi> ſhall moſt certainly be damned. For this follows from the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by an undeniable conſequence: and therefore the Apoſtle takes it for granted, appeals to your own Judgment, and leaves it to your ſelves to determine the queſtion in the words of my Text; <hi>If the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the Ungodly and the Sinner appear?</hi> If the Righteous that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſo many Troubles, hath taken ſo much pains to ſubdue and mortifie his Luſts, hath with ſo much Conſtancy and Reſolution turned away his Eyes and his Heart from the bewitching Baits and enſnaring Pomps and Vanities of this ſinful World, hath with ſo much Courage and Faith reſiſted the Temptations of Satan, and <hi>quenched all the fiery Darts of the Wicked,</hi> hath with ſo much Patience and Meekneſs born his Croſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Afflictions and ſufferings of this preſent
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107594:94"/>Life, is after all theſe painful and glorious Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, even when he hath gained a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Victory over all his Spiritual Enemies, and is a Triumphant Conquerour over Principalities and Powers, ſtill but an unprofitable Servant, and dares not appear before God's Tribunal, truſting in his own Righteouſneſs, but <hi>in that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith,</hi> how then ſhall the Ungodly and the Sinner, that hath taken no pains at all, to <hi>fight the good Fight of Faith,</hi> that hath let looſe the Reins to his Luſts, that hath yielded himſelf a Slave to his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that hath put God out of all his Thoughts, hath ſet-his Heart and Affections wholly upon the things which are on Earth, and glutted himſelf with ſenſual Pleaſures, hath harkned to the wicked ſuggeſtions of the Devil, <hi>hath walked according to the Courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that works in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> hath enjoyed his good things in this Life, and hath not <hi>come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to trouble like other Men,</hi> be able to ſtand before the Righteous <hi>Judge of all the Earth,</hi> when he ſhall be ſummoned to give an account of all his Actions done in the fleſh. The caſe is plain: he ſhall not be able to ſtand at all; but ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with everlaſting Confuſion, and Miſery and Deſpair. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ſhall not ſtand in the Judgment, nor Sinners in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Righteous: For the Lord knoweth the way of the Righteous, but the way of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſhall periſh,</hi> Pſal. 1.5, 6.</p>
               <p>If then we deſire to ſtand in that great Day, and to lift up our Heads with joy at the coming of our Saviour, let us reſolve and labour with all our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107594:94"/>Might, now to ſtand and fight the Lords Battles Manfully againſt all the Enemies of our Souls. Ye ſee in what Circumſtances we are, how great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition every faithful Champion of Jeſus Chriſt is like to meet with in this troubleſome Wilderneſs, before he can arrive at his heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> But though the difficulties which threaten us be great, yet they are not inſuperable; but we may by the Aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit (who is ready to help our Infirmities) overcome them if we will. Let not any thing then diſcourage nor affright us from our perſeverance in well-doing: but let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate our ſelves by the Example of the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Martyrs and Confeſſours to <hi>run with patience the race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the Authour and finiſher of our Faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the Right-hand of the Throne of God. Let us conſider him that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſuch Contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf; leaſt we be wearied and faint in our Minds.</hi> So God will certainly give a bleſſing to our endeavours: his Grace will be ever ready to prevent, aſſiſt, and further us in all our Actions here; and his Bounty will not fail to crown us with Glory, and Honour, and Immortality hereafter.</p>

               <p>OF all thoſe manifold and ſubtile Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, with which the great Enemy of our Salvation ſeeks to beguile us of our Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Inheritance, there is none more dangerous, than that by which he end eavours to perſwade us, that we have already attained to ſuch a Meaſure of Perfection that we are fully ripe for Heaven, and that our Faith is ſo ſtrong, that it is able to <hi>quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,</hi> to baffle the ſtrongeſt Temptation with which it can be aſſaulted, and to ſtand invincible, even unto the End, againſt all the Force and Policy of the Powers of Darkneſs. This Temptation had prevailed ſo far among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that many of them were ſo puffed up with the conceit they had of that great profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, they had made in the School of Chriſt, and of that knowledge they had gained in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel, under ſo excellent a Tutour as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that they thought that now they had done their work, and that they were paſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107594:95"/>of falling away from Chriſt. And particularly upon the Notion they had entertained of Chriſtian Liberty, they ventured upon ſome Actions, which though they might perhaps in ſome Caſes be in themſelves lawful; yet upon the Account that they gave offence to weaker brethren, they could not be practiſed by them without breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and were therefore by this Circumſtance ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſinful and hurtful to their own Souls. One of which practices was their eating of things offer'd to Idols: which though the Apoſtle ſeems to grant to be a thing indifferent to them that have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to diſcern, that an Idol <hi>is nothing in the World,</hi> and <hi>that meat commendeth us not to God:</hi> but that <hi>if we eat we are not the better; neither if we eat not are we the worſe:</hi> yet he adviſes them to <hi>take heed leaſt by any means this liberty of theirs become a Stumbling block to them that are weak, leaſt through their knowledge the weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died.</hi> Therefore from this abuſe of their Chriſtian Liberty and from that too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Opinion of that knowledge and Faith which God had beſtowed upon them, he labours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them in ſeverall Chapters of this Epiſtle. And this he doth firſt by propounding to them his own Example, ſhewing them, that as to the point of Chriſtian Liberty he was ſo tender of the Salvation of all Men, that he very frequently abridged himſelf of that Liberty which otherwiſe he might have uſed, and that he <hi>became all things to all Men, that he might by all means ſave ſome;</hi> and <hi>that he would eat no fleſh while the World ſtands, rather than by ſo doing to make his brother to offend.</hi> And as for being puffed up with the conſideration of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107594:96"/>the manifold Graces which God had beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him he declares that he was ſo far from it that inſtead of that he ſtill called to mind the length of that race which he had to run before he could obtain the Prize; leaſt he ſhould faint and come ſhort of it; and the ſtrength of thoſe Enemies which he had to overcome; leaſt by his careleſneſs and ſecurity he ſhould give them an occaſion to get an advantage over him. <hi>I therefore ſo run,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not as uncertainly; ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the Air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection: leaſt that by any Means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away,</hi> Chap. 9.26, 27. And leſt his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhould not be ſufficient to diſſwade them from this Spiritual Pride, he propounds to them in the ſecond Place the Example of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the beginning of this tenth Chapter unto my Text. God had beſtowed moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Graces and Favours upon that People, and yet upon their abuſe of them he was ſo highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at them, that he deſtroyed them all in the Wilderneſs, but two; and not one of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> entered into the Land of Promiſe, but only <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua. Now theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were our Examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</hi> They who had received great Grace under the Law, by their abuſe of it came ſhort of their earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and we who have received far greater Grace under the Goſpel, may by our abuſe of it come ſhort likewiſe of our heavenly one. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinketh,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>In the handling of which words I ſhall do theſe three Things. 1. I ſhall ſhew you, that they who think they ſtand, nay, that do ſtand, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> are for the preſent true Believers, may neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depart from the Faith, and fall from Grace. 2. That it is every Man's Duty to take heed leſt he do ſo fall. 3. I ſhall give you ſome neceſſary Rules and Directions to be obſerved by all that will take heed that they do not ſo fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay that true Believers may depart from the Faith, and fall from Grace. And here by true Believers, I mean not the Elect: For altho' even they alſo may fall for a time; yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they ſhall riſe again (for as much as God's Election ever ſuppoſes and includes final Perſeverance) whereas the other, though they be for the preſent regenerate and true Believers, (though not Elect) may fall from Grace, not only totally, but finally, ſo as never to riſe again by Repentance. And this, as it is the expreſs Doctrine of our Church, which declares in her ſixteenth Article, <hi>That after we have received the Holy Ghoſt, we may depart from Grace given, and fall into Sin,</hi> ſo it is moſt agreeable alſo to the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, as will appear by theſe following Inſtances. 1. It is plain from our Saviour's Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. of the Servant unto whom his Lord upon his humble Supplication, freely forgave that vaſt Debt of ten thouſand Talents, which he was in no wiſe able to pay, by which is meant God's pardoning and juſtifying of a Sinner upon his true Repentance: As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Servant forfeited his Lord's Favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by his Cruelty to his Fellow-ſervant, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107594:97"/>may he that is at the preſent regenerate and reconciled unto God, fall again into a State of Damnation. 2. There is nothing more plain than this from thoſe Paſſages, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. &amp; 33.12. <hi>When the Righteous turneth away from his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, and doth according to all the Abominations, that the wicked Man doth, ſhall he live? All his Righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned: in his Treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die.</hi> Again, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of the Righteous ſhall not deliver him in the Day of his Tranſgreſſion; as for the Wickedneſs of the Wicked, he ſhall not fall thereby in the Day that he turneth from his Wickedneſs; neither ſhall the Righteous be able to live for his Righteouſneſs in the Day that he ſinneth.</hi> Without all Controverſie by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in theſe Places is meant, one who is truly and indeed righteous and juſt in the ſight of God; as appears by the Deſcription which he gives of him from the 5th Verſe of this 18th Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> unto the 10th, where he expreſly declares him to be <hi>one that hath walked in his Statutes, and hath kept his Judgments to deal truly.</hi> For if we ſhould underſtand it otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of one that was only outwardly and hypocritically Righteous, theſe Texts would be down-right Non-ſenſe, and muſt mean this (which is indeed nothing) <hi>When the Righteous</hi> (i. e. the Hypocrite) <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away from his Righteouſneſs,</hi> (i. e. his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrifie) <hi>he ſhall die.</hi> Certainly God would never threaten to puniſh any Soul with Death for tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away from Hypocrifie; neither would he oppoſe Hypocrifie to Iniquity, as a thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107594:97"/>to it, when he hath ſo frequently declared in his word, that Hypocrifie it ſelf is moſt groſs Iniquity, ſuch as his Soul abhors. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot ſuppoſe God here to ſpeak of Counterfeit and Hypocritical Righteouſneſs, it muſt needs follow from theſe Texts of Scripture, That he who was once truly Righteous may turn from ſuch Righteouſneſs, and commit Iniquity, may fall from Grace into a State of Damnation, and that he may continue in ſuch a State, and die in his Sins. Again, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is evident from our Saviour's Parable, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away.</hi> Now no Man can ever be a Branch of this Heavenly Vine (which is Jeſus Chriſt) but by a true Faith: And yet our Saviour declares here, that ſuch a Branch as this, that was once in him, may ceaſe to bear Fruit, and thereupon be taken away; ſuch a Man may depart from the Faith, and fall from Chriſt. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This is clear from that Paſſage, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>If after they have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, through the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome, the latter End is worſe with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the Holy Commandment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them;</hi> unto which Place, that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. is parallel. From both which Places it appears, that <hi>they who were once enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and had taſted of the Heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107594:98"/>the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come;</hi> that <hi>they who have eſcaped the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the World, through the Knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (i. e.) by a true Faith in him (for none but ſuch can enable any Man to eſcape thoſe Pollutions) may notwithſtanding all this fall away, ay, and fall ſo too, that it ſhall be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to renew them again unto Repentance.</hi> I might produce many more Texts of Scripture for the Confirmation of this Doctrine: But I ſhall content my ſelf with thoſe, which I have already cited; and for the further Proof of it, I ſhall inſiſt upon ſome few Examples of holy and juſt Men in Scripture who have fallen from Grace; which certainly were recorded on purpoſe to teach us this excellent Leſſon here in my Text, that <hi>he that thinks he ſtands may take heed leſt he fall.</hi> And here I ſhall omit the Caſe of the fallen Angels who were once Holy, but <hi>kept not their firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> and the Caſe of our Firſt Parents, who though they were created by God in his own Image, in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, yet quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell from that happy Condition into a State of Sin and Miſery. But the Examples I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon ſhall be theſe. 1. <hi>Saul,</hi> who certainly at the firſt was a pious and good King, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he became quite otherwiſe, and was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rejected of God for his Diſobedience. The Adverſaries to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Doctrine object, that <hi>Saul</hi> never was really good nor endued with true Grace. But for all that, the Story tells us plainly, that the Spirit of the Lord came upon <hi>Saul,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon him while he behaved himſelf well; and that afterwards he departed from him, and an
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107594:98"/>evil Spirit from the Lord troubled him. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unto whomſoever the bleſſed Spirit of God vouchſafes to come, Grace, and true Grace too, muſt needs come along with him, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Authour of it, and if ever he departs (though but for a ſeaſon,) Grace can never ſtay behind him. They therefore, that deny, that <hi>Saul</hi> had once true Grace, may with as good reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the Man in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. that received but one Talent, ever had a true Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: and then he had very hard meaſure to be condemned for not putting it to the Exchangers, when he had received nothing but falſe Coyn. But if this Example be not ſatisfactory, perhaps the next may, and that ſhall be that of <hi>David,</hi> who the Scripture tells us, was a Man after God's own Heart; and there is no Man but will readily acknowledge that God had beſtowed upon him an extraordinary Meaſure of Grace. And yet by thoſe two grievous Sins of Adultery, and Murder, he fell from this Grace, and continued in a ſtate of Sin, and damnation, for the ſpace of many Months together and never thought of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, until he was reſtored again by the Miniſtery of the Prophet <hi>Nathan.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us expreſly, that <hi>Adulterers ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 6.9. And S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer hath Eternal Life abiding in him,</hi> 1 John 3.15. It is manifeſt therefore that by theſe Sins, <hi>David</hi> did fall from Grace, and had he died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance muſt have periſhed Eternally. I might inſtance further in <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was once beloved of the Lord, and yet in his old Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Idolater; in S. <hi>Peter</hi> who denied his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107594:99"/>in <hi>Demas,</hi> who was once one of the fellow-labourers with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and perhaps one of thoſe he means, Phil. 4.3. <hi>whoſe Names were in the Book of Life;</hi> yet he <hi>forſook S. Paul, having loved this preſent World,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.10: but by what I have ſaid already, it is ſufficiently evident, from Scripture, that true believers may depart from the Faith, and fall from Grace. I ſhall inſtance only in one thing more, to ſhew that this is agreeable to the Doctrine of our Church. In the Rubrick after the Order of publick Baptiſm of Infants, the Church tells us, that it is certain by God's Word, that Children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual <hi>Sin, are undoubtedly ſaved.</hi> Now it is as certain, by God's Word, that no Man can be ſaved but by Grace: and then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows on the one hand, that all Infants in their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm do receive Grace; or elſe by virtue of their baptiſm, without it, they cannot be ſaved: and it follows likewiſe on the other hand, that they that have received grace may fall from it, or elſe no Children, that have been baptized, can be damned; which no Man living will admit of. It is manifeſt therefore that they that have Grace may fall away from it. And if ſo, then certainly it is every Mans Duty to take heed leſt he do ſo fall.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſecond thing I propounded to ſpeak of. <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands take heed leſt he fall.</hi> To fall, let it be in what manner it will, always implies danger and miſchief: but to fall from Grace is the moſt dangerous and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fall imaginable. It is a fall from Chriſt, a fall from God, a fall from Salvation, a fall, like
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107594:99"/>that of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> from the higheſt Heavens into the bottomleſs Pit, a fall from the Glory, and Light, and Happineſs of the bright Sons of the Morning into the Eternal Confuſion, and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Miſery of the Children of Perdition. Of all the rich Jewels which God hath to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, there is none ſo precious as that of Grace: For upon whomſoever he beſtows this, upon him he deſigns to beſtow Heaven it ſelf, Grace being the only ſure and certain Guide to conduct us to thoſe bleſſed Manſions of Everlaſting Glory. Without this we are able of our ſelves to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all that is good; we cannot walk one ſtep in the way of Life; we cannot do a good Action, nor think a good Thought, except the Holy Spirit of God enable us, <hi>Who works in us both to will, and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi> The Enemies of our Salvation are both numerous and powerful, and the very weakeſt of them will be ſure to be too ſtrong for us, if we be not aſſiſted from on high: <hi>For we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt Spiritual Wickedneſs in high Places,</hi> againſt ſuch Adverſaries as (if they were not reſtrained by the Omnipotent Power of God) would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy the whole Race of Man, and cauſe Confuſion and Deſolation throughout all the Earth. How doth it behove us therefore, that we may be able to overcome them, to take unto us the whole Armour of God; the Girdle of Truth, the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit? It is Grace alone that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107594:100"/>can furniſh us with theſe Weapons: And ſo long as we are thus armed we may aſſure our ſelves, that the Gates of Hell ſhall never be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt us. But if once we fall from Grace, and thereby diſarm our ſelves of all this Spiritual Armour, how can we expect then to fight the Lord's Battels, when we have caſt away the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Warfare. That roaring Lion that ſeeks to devour us, and dares venture to aſſault us when we are armed <hi>Cap a pe,</hi> with the Armour of Heaven, though he dreads a Wound from the Sword of the Spirit, and knows that the Shield of Faith is impregnable againſt all his fiery Darts, will eaſily make a Prey of a naked and defenceleſs Soul, a Soul that hath forſaken God, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forſaken of him, and delivered into the Hands of the Enemy, to be <hi>taken Captive by him at his Will.</hi> Let us take heed then, leſt having begun in the Spirit we end in the Fleſh; leſt having once <hi>run well</hi> we turn aſide, <hi>and leave the Paths of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, to walk in the ways of Darkneſs;</hi> leſt having for ſome time fought manfully under Chriſt's Banner the good Fight of Faith, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards grow weary and faint, deſert our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, make ſhipwreck of our Faith, and forſake the Captain of our Salvation. <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> And ſo I come to the laſt thing I undertook to do in handling theſe words, which is</p>
               <p>To give you ſome neceſſary Rules and Directions to be obſerved by all that will take heed that they do not ſo fall. Firſt, then, that we may take heed that we do not fall, let us remember that we may fall. As there is a poſſibility for him
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107594:100"/>that is already fallen to riſe again; for him that is at the preſent defiled with the pollutions of Sin to be waſhed again, and ſanctified, and cleanſed from thoſe Pollutions; for him that is at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity,</hi> entangled in the ſnare of Satan, to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that Bondage into the Glorious Liberty of the Children of God;</hi> and therefore we ought not to deſpair of the Salvation of any Man: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is a poſſibility for him that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent runs well the good race that is ſet before him to faint before he comes to the End of it and by ſo doing to loſe his Prize; for him that for a <hi>while believed in time of Temptation, when tribulation or perſecution ariſes becauſe of the word to be offended and fall away;</hi> for him who <hi>had once eſcaped the Pollutions of the World through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to be again entangled therein and overcome; inſomuch that his latter end ſhall be worſe than the beginning:</hi> and therefore no Man ought to be over confident, and ſecure, of his final Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor to preſume that becauſe at the preſent, upon a ſtrict Examination of his Conſcience, and of the Condition of his Soul, he finds that he is in a State of Grace, that that State is unalterable and that he ſhall infallibly continue in it unto his life's end: for he that thinks he ſtands may fall. And of what a dangerous Conſequence ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is we may ſee by the Example of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and indeed of all the reſt of our Saviour's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: for as they all joyned with S. <hi>Peter</hi> in that good Reſolution of never forſaking Chriſt (for <hi>Peter ſaid unto him, Though I ſhould die with thee yet will I not deny thee. Likewiſe alſo ſaid all the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107594:101"/>Diſciples</hi>) ſo they did all of them in effect joyn with him alſo in the denial of him, for S. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, that <hi>they all forſook him and fled.</hi> But S. <hi>Peter</hi> that was the moſt confident of all denies him the moſt ſhamefully and baſely of all, with Oaths and Curſes, ſwearing that he knew him not. Thus dangerous was Preſumption to that great Saint, and it will be as dangerous to every one of us, if we entertain it in our Hearts. He that thinks he ſtands ſo firm that he can never fall, 'tis much to be feared that he is fallen already, and fallen ſo low, that he is in danger never to riſe again; except it be by ſome extraordinary Act of Mercy, ſuch as our Saviour ſhewed to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>he turned and looked upon him</hi> after his fall, and by that look infuſed new Grace into his Heart, which immediately burſt out at his Eyes, in tears of repentance. Let us not therefore be high minded, but let us fear: for <hi>happy is the Man that feareth alway: but he that hardneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs 28.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> if we will take heed that we fall not from Grace, let us take heed that we fall not into Sin, eſpecially into preſumptuous and willful Sin, againſt the light of our conſcience. All Sin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, though it be but a Sin of Ignorance, or Infirmity, tends more or leſs (if it be not ſpeedily repented of) to the impairing, and diminiſhing of the Grace of God in our Hearts; which is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us on purpoſe to preſerve, and defend us from the power of Sin, that <hi>it may not Reign in our mortal Bodies, that we ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> But Sins of Preſumption and Wilfulneſs againſt our knowledge, and the checks of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, do not only much impair Grace, but they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107594:101"/>totally exſtinguiſh it, and bring us into great danger of final Apoſtacy. For there can be no fellowſhip betwixt Righteouſneſs and Unrighteouſneſs, no Communion betwixt Light and Darkneſs, no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betwixt Chriſt and Belial, no Agreement nor Cohabitation of the Spirit of God and Satan. And therefore <hi>David</hi> prays moſt earneſtly againſt ſuch Sins as theſe, Pſal. 19.13. <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous Sins: let them not have domminion over me: then ſhall I be upright, and I ſhall be innocent from the great Tranſgreſſion.</hi> And how deadly a wound ſuch Sins make in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, God for our inſtruction (that his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be a warning to us to beware of the like Sins) ſuffered him to find by a ſad Experience. That premeditated wilful Murder of one of his innocent ſubjects changed the Man after God's own Heart into one after the Heart of him who <hi>was a murderer from the beginning,</hi> and made him ſuch an one as Satan would have all Men to be, if he could prevail. It is impoſſible while he was in this Condition, that he ſhould find any comfort in the performance of his Devotions, if he did then perform any at all. His Hand, his Tongue, his Heart were all out of tune, all unfit for the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of God's Praiſes in which they were wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap> continually to be imployed. Even his own ſacred Hymns, and Anthems were nauſeous to him, and <hi>the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael</hi> was become a ſtranger to the ſongs of <hi>Sion.</hi> Grace was then loſt, and Sin reigned in him; the Spirit of God had for that Time forſaken him, and Satan had taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Soul. Let us take heed then of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and wilful Sins (and every habitual
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107594:102"/>Sin is a ſtep towards them, they wrought a ſad change in <hi>David;</hi> but they may work a worſe in us. God was pleaſed to raiſe him again: but if we fall after the ſame manner, he may perhaps deny the ſame Favour to us, and then our Caſe is irrecoverable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we will take heed that we fall not from Grace, let us endeavour daily to grow in it, and improve it. So S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us, in the end of his Second Epiſtle. <hi>Ye therefore beloved ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own ſteadfaſtneſs. But grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He that thinks he hath Grace enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath indeed very little, or none at all: but <hi>bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for they ſhall be filled. The path of the juſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, is as the ſhining Light, that ſhineth more, and more unto the perfect Day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. And our bleſſed Saviour compares the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (by which is meant the Grace of God in our Hearts) <hi>unto a grain of muſtard ſeed, which though it be leſs than all the ſeeds that be in the earth, yet when it is ſown, it grows up, and becomes a tree.</hi> So likewiſe ſhould the Grace of God grow, and increaſe, in our Hearts, and ſo it will do, if it be not (purely by our own fault) hindered and ſtifled. That we may not therefore fall from Grace, let us be careful to improve that Grace which God hath already beſtowed upon us, by waiting upon him duly, and conſtantly in all thoſe Ordinances, which he hath appointed for the begetting, preſerving, and increaſing it in our
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107594:102"/>Souls: ſuch as are diligent Reading and Meditating in his Word at home, hearing it preached and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in his Houſe, frequent receiving the Holy Sacrament, and praying unto God continually both in private and publick as our Church teaches us, <hi>that his Grace may always prevent and follow us; and make us continually to be given to all good Works.</hi> He that doth theſe things in Truth and ſincerity ſhall never fall; God will never leave nor forſake ſuch a Man, but will be ſure to <hi>guide him with his Counſel here, and afterward receive him to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
